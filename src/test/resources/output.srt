1
00:00:30,828 --> 00:00:32,606
- Have a brilliant day.
- Yeah, thank you.

2
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,097
You too.

3
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,534
Morning. What can I get you?

4
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:38,702
- Where's curly-hair lady?
- Sara?

5
00:00:38,736 --> 00:00:40,403
She's out sick. Or at least,

6
00:00:40,436 --> 00:00:41,739
- that's what she says.
- Oh.

7
00:00:41,772 --> 00:00:43,473
She's got a new boyfriend.

8
00:00:43,507 --> 00:00:44,608
What can I get you?

9
00:00:44,642 --> 00:00:46,342
Usually it's my usual

10
00:00:46,376 --> 00:00:47,587
and she usually has it ready
because I'm usually late.

11
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:49,479
Well, don't keep me in suspense.

12
00:00:49,513 --> 00:00:52,115
Um, it's a PB and BRHC
on a roll.

13
00:00:52,148 --> 00:00:53,784
Okay, so...

14
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:55,795
- "PB" would be peanut butter, I'm assuming?
- Yes.

15
00:00:55,819 --> 00:00:58,154
"BR," bananas, raisins. "H,"
honey. "C," cheese on a roll.

16
00:00:58,187 --> 00:01:00,390
Aren't you blessed
with a fast metabolism.

17
00:01:00,423 --> 00:01:02,526
Are you running a marathon
or something?

18
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,696
You know, my sister ran a marathon once,
God rest her soul.

19
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:07,831
She's not dead.
She's just exhausted.

20
00:01:07,865 --> 00:01:10,433
We get it, Sharon. You ran.

21
00:01:10,466 --> 00:01:12,168
But everyone has to work
in the morning.

22
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:13,813
Yeah, I have to go to work,
three minutes ago.

23
00:01:13,837 --> 00:01:16,172
And, sorry,
I'm in sort of a rush for the sandwich.

24
00:01:16,205 --> 00:01:19,475
You can't
rush a good sandwich, dude.

25
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:24,682
<i>Alfred, really can't talk.</i>

26
00:01:24,715 --> 00:01:26,182
Good morning, Mr. Allen.

27
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:27,785
<i>No, I'm late.</i>

28
00:01:27,818 --> 00:01:29,395
And I'm starving,
and curly-haired girl isn't here

29
00:01:29,419 --> 00:01:30,730
and her name is Sara,
and she has a boyfriend.

30
00:01:30,754 --> 00:01:32,590
We have a situation
at Gotham General.

31
00:01:32,623 --> 00:01:34,357
A robbery gone wrong.

32
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,326
This is
the middle of the morning.

33
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:38,729
Why is our bat-friend
even awake?

34
00:01:38,762 --> 00:01:40,396
Call Superman.

35
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,198
That was my first thought.

36
00:01:42,231 --> 00:01:44,233
<i>Sadly, he's otherwise engaged.</i>

37
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:45,845
<i>- Active volcano in Central America.</i>
- Classic.

38
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:46,804
What about Diana?

39
00:01:46,837 --> 00:01:48,371
My other first thought.

40
00:01:48,404 --> 00:01:50,641
Rather annoyingly,
she's not picking up.

41
00:01:50,674 --> 00:01:53,385
How many first thoughts, exactly, did
you have before you first thought of me?

42
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:54,912
Never about her.

43
00:01:54,945 --> 00:01:56,322
- This is about you.
- Hi, sorry. Is my sandwich...

44
00:01:56,346 --> 00:01:57,514
I learned my lesson

45
00:01:57,548 --> 00:01:59,148
on the boat last year.

46
00:01:59,182 --> 00:02:00,927
Stuff my sister comes out with
when she's drunk.

47
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:03,152
Personal comments about
my mom's friends as well,

48
00:02:03,186 --> 00:02:04,855
which I think
is what I say about her...

49
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:16,843
Oh, my God!

50
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:18,802
Flash!

51
00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:20,738
- Hi. Thank you.
- I love you.

52
00:02:20,771 --> 00:02:22,740
- You seem very nice also.
- Oh, my God!

53
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:24,708
- No way!
- I think I'm gonna die!

54
00:02:24,742 --> 00:02:26,442
Patching you into Mr. Wayne.

55
00:02:26,476 --> 00:02:27,721
No, please don't.

56
00:02:27,745 --> 00:02:29,913
Oh, my God.

57
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:32,358
Sorry if this sounds weird,
but are you actively eating that candy bar?

58
00:02:32,382 --> 00:02:33,851
Maybe you could throw it to me?

59
00:02:33,884 --> 00:02:35,786
- In the name of justice.
- Yes, yes.

60
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,788
<i>I need you here now, Barry.</i>

61
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:39,823
Hi, Bruce. Yes, I'm...

62
00:02:39,857 --> 00:02:40,857
coming.

63
00:03:03,614 --> 00:03:07,518

00:03:44,888 --> 00:03:45,923
No, no!

70
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:55,966
Bruce, this is a huge mess.

71
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:57,300
Why aren't you here?

72
00:04:16,053 --> 00:04:19,288
<i>Bruce, why does
it sound like you're fleeing the scene?</i>

73
00:04:19,322 --> 00:04:22,826
Falcone's idiot kid decided to
try to play in the big leagues.

74
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,696
<i>He put a crew together and broke
into the lab at Gotham General.</i>

75
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:27,898
<i>Stole a highly deadly virus.</i>

76
00:04:27,931 --> 00:04:31,300
<i>I intercepted them,
but they blasted their way out.</i>

77
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:33,436
You can handle the hospital,
Barry.

78
00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:34,981
Somebody has to save the rest of the world,
so I was gonna do that.

79
00:04:35,005 --> 00:04:36,439
If you don't mind.

80
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:37,741
Sounds about right, Bruce.

81
00:04:58,128 --> 00:05:00,363
"Thanks for saving me
from the sinkhole, Flash."

82
00:05:00,396 --> 00:05:02,533
Barry, gas
and water pipes ruptured.

83
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:03,967
In the basement.

84
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:05,002
Right.

85
00:05:06,402 --> 00:05:07,571
On it.

86
00:05:19,883 --> 00:05:21,350
Can you open it?

87
00:05:21,384 --> 00:05:22,886
- I think it's locked.
- It's jammed.

88
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,721
God, it's not working!

89
00:05:24,755 --> 00:05:26,023
Oh, please!

90
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:38,001
Look, Alfred.
I've come to accept

91
00:05:38,035 --> 00:05:40,971
that I'm essentially the
janitor of the Justice League.

92
00:05:41,004 --> 00:05:42,506
Which sucks.

93
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,541
But I've come to accept it.

94
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,642
But...

95
00:05:45,676 --> 00:05:47,578
I can't help but notice...

96
00:05:47,611 --> 00:05:50,479
that it always seems to be
a bat-mess...

97
00:05:50,514 --> 00:05:51,514
that I'm cleaning up.

98
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:56,620
- Right this way. Eyes forward.
- Yes.

99
00:05:56,653 --> 00:05:58,922
- Stay together, now.
- Yeah, I know, right?

100
00:06:07,496 --> 00:06:08,496
Look out!

101
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,511
- Wow. Whoa.
- What?

102
00:07:03,486 --> 00:07:05,689
If my calculations are correct,

103
00:07:05,722 --> 00:07:07,891
and history will prove
they usually are,

104
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:12,562
the foundational damage is about to
cause the collapse of the east wing.

105
00:07:12,596 --> 00:07:15,766
- East wing's fine.
- All right, I got you.

106
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:17,634
Which is good
because my speed is lagging.

107
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:18,945
Running on empty, Alfred.

108
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:21,138
Do you hear that?

109
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:22,172
That's my stomach.

110
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:29,079
No, no.

111
00:07:29,112 --> 00:07:30,479
It's the collapsing east wing.

112
00:07:47,531 --> 00:07:49,700
<i>Barry, 30th floor.</i>

113
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:51,101
There's a baby...

114
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:54,104
Shower.

115
00:10:22,452 --> 00:10:23,452
Oh!

116
00:10:24,387 --> 00:10:25,387
Oh!

117
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:39,102
Mr. Allen,

118
00:10:39,136 --> 00:10:41,705
you've made me very proud.

119
00:10:41,738 --> 00:10:43,240
And a lot of mothers very happy.

120
00:10:43,273 --> 00:10:44,274
Oh!

121
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,414
Yeah.

122
00:10:52,349 --> 00:10:54,251
Okay.

123
00:10:54,284 --> 00:10:57,754
I understand that these events
can be psychologically scarring.

124
00:10:57,787 --> 00:11:00,891
You should seek the services
of a mental health professional.

125
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:03,927
The Justice League is not
very good at that part yet.

126
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,195
Trust me.

127
00:11:05,228 --> 00:11:06,228
God.

128
00:11:45,536 --> 00:11:48,104
Shake him off!

129
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:38,255
If that briefcase
falls into the water,

130
00:12:38,288 --> 00:12:41,024
it could wipe out
half of Gotham by lunchtime.

131
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:45,895
- Damn it.
- Please don't drop me.

132
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:49,132
Oh, God, no.
Please, please don't.

133
00:12:49,165 --> 00:12:50,166
No!

134
00:12:56,873 --> 00:12:58,041
Sorry I'm late.

135
00:13:04,047 --> 00:13:05,047
Watch your step.

136
00:13:06,182 --> 00:13:07,317
- Hi.
- Hey.

137
00:13:09,853 --> 00:13:11,187
Nice suit.

138
00:13:11,221 --> 00:13:12,389
Looking good, Flash.

139
00:13:12,422 --> 00:13:14,424
Oh, uh... Thank... Uh...

140
00:13:15,892 --> 00:13:16,993
And you...

141
00:13:17,528 --> 00:13:19,362
are welcome.

142
00:13:19,396 --> 00:13:20,940
My ego's far too big to say
"thank you" to someone else.

143
00:13:20,964 --> 00:13:21,965
Hmm.

144
00:13:24,434 --> 00:13:26,436
I developed this...

145
00:13:26,469 --> 00:13:28,515
all-powerful persona to compensate
for my childhood trauma...

146
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:30,240
I, too, have childhood trauma.

147
00:13:30,273 --> 00:13:32,175
Batman seems crazy.

148
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,487
- The Lasso of Truth...
- Billion dollar. She's the mother...

149
00:13:33,511 --> 00:13:35,211
never gets old.

150
00:13:35,245 --> 00:13:37,247
I'd do a lot better
just giving all my money away.

151
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,891
Yes, if I really wanted to end crime,
I should end poverty.

152
00:13:38,915 --> 00:13:40,618
I know sex exists.

153
00:13:40,651 --> 00:13:42,952
I've just never experienced it.

154
00:13:44,187 --> 00:13:45,221
Damn it.

155
00:13:45,255 --> 00:13:46,323
Well...

156
00:13:46,356 --> 00:13:47,991
I have to run.

157
00:13:48,024 --> 00:13:49,359
Yeah.

158
00:13:49,392 --> 00:13:50,493
Always a pleasure.

159
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:55,865
The sex thing was a metaphor...

160
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:58,068
for gothic literature.

161
00:13:58,101 --> 00:13:59,345
There was just no way
to recover from that.

162
00:13:59,369 --> 00:14:02,105
Just let it go.

163
00:14:02,138 --> 00:14:04,608
Well, I'd really love to stay
and clean up more mess...

164
00:14:04,642 --> 00:14:07,010
but this little superhero
needs his breakfast.

165
00:14:07,043 --> 00:14:08,912
Goodbye, Flash.

166
00:14:08,945 --> 00:14:10,280
Yeah. Bye, Batman.

167
00:14:11,281 --> 00:14:13,216
Well done, Mr. Wayne.

168
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:15,118
<i>Will you be home
for breakfast, sir?</i>

169
00:14:18,455 --> 00:14:20,156
Yes, I think so.

170
00:14:22,258 --> 00:14:23,460
The road to destruction.

171
00:14:23,493 --> 00:14:25,629
This was never about her.

172
00:14:25,663 --> 00:14:27,163
This is about you.

173
00:14:27,197 --> 00:14:30,233
You have to stop
living in the past.

174
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:32,035
Now, was that
fast enough for you?

175
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:37,508
Morning, professor...

176
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,415
Ah, look who's here.

177
00:14:45,448 --> 00:14:47,083
Shut up, Albert.

178
00:14:47,117 --> 00:14:49,352
Every day. I don't know
how you do it, Barry.

179
00:14:49,386 --> 00:14:50,920
What'd you, like,
crawl here, bro?

180
00:14:50,954 --> 00:14:52,623
- Is he mad?
- Well, you're getting fired.

181
00:14:52,656 --> 00:14:54,501
- You're getting murdered.
- Oh, no, no, no.

182
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:56,025
Let me guess.

183
00:14:56,059 --> 00:14:57,661
Your alarm clock didn't go off.

184
00:14:57,695 --> 00:15:00,631
- No...
- Oh, your dog ate your alarm clock.

185
00:15:00,664 --> 00:15:02,633
Your alarm clock ate your keys.

186
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,603
Your keys' grandmother died,
and they need a personal day.

187
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:08,104
- It was none of those things.
- What was it this time, Barry?

188
00:15:08,138 --> 00:15:10,006
It was, um, something else

189
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,642
that was far less outlandish.

190
00:15:11,675 --> 00:15:14,043
And I know
I missed the meeting...

191
00:15:14,077 --> 00:15:16,021
but I'd still really like to present
these case files for potential review.

192
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:17,380
I think we rushed these cases.

193
00:15:17,414 --> 00:15:19,349
- We need to reopen them.
- Oh! Rushed?

194
00:15:19,382 --> 00:15:22,285
We got a backlog six months deep,
and you want us to move slower?

195
00:15:22,318 --> 00:15:24,421
You need to focus your motion.

196
00:15:24,454 --> 00:15:27,056
Do the work,
close the case, move on.

197
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,161
You have
a lot of potential, Barry.

198
00:15:31,194 --> 00:15:34,063
You shouldn't still be getting
me coffee after all these years.

199
00:15:34,097 --> 00:15:36,667
You're right. That's...
That's true.

200
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,735
Go get me a coffee.

201
00:15:41,104 --> 00:15:43,473
- Two sugars? Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

202
00:15:57,187 --> 00:15:59,088
You're gonna love this.

203
00:15:59,122 --> 00:16:00,534
I'm very satisfied with the
ruling in the Johnson case.

204
00:16:00,558 --> 00:16:03,561
The evidence our lab analyzed...

205
00:16:03,594 --> 00:16:06,996
was more than sufficient
to be conclusive.

206
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,567
- I'm still working that evidence.
- Because of the diligence

207
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,702
and hard work and focus...

208
00:16:11,735 --> 00:16:14,337
Barry was still working
on that evidence.

209
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,039
Think if it were up to you

210
00:16:16,072 --> 00:16:18,007
that we'd still be scraping
Ted Bundy's molars.

211
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:21,311
You know what? I'm so happy
you find this all so hilarious,

212
00:16:21,344 --> 00:16:25,181
but we are dealing with real
people's lives, people's families.

213
00:16:25,215 --> 00:16:27,350
And I don't think you can grasp
the gravity of that.

214
00:16:27,383 --> 00:16:29,152
So, why don't you
leave me alone?

215
00:16:29,185 --> 00:16:31,354
- Barry Allen?
- Iris West.

216
00:16:31,789 --> 00:16:33,156
You...

217
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:35,391
know my full name also.

218
00:16:35,425 --> 00:16:37,293
Yes, from school.

219
00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:39,438
Aw, Barry, you didn't tell us
you had a friend from school.

220
00:16:39,462 --> 00:16:41,340
- We actually didn't know that Barry had a friend.
- Wow.

221
00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:43,199
Yeah, what does that
make it now?

222
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:44,234
- One?
- One.

223
00:16:44,267 --> 00:16:46,537
You guys are so...

224
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,572
Um, bye, you guys.

225
00:16:48,606 --> 00:16:50,139
Okay. Oh, my God.
That was just...

226
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:51,675
Um...

227
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:54,143
They're not really my friends.
They're my work friends.

228
00:16:54,177 --> 00:16:55,345
Do you work here?

229
00:16:55,378 --> 00:16:56,714
Yes, I do.

230
00:16:56,747 --> 00:16:58,616
God, it's been a long time, huh?

231
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:00,483
Hmm.

232
00:17:00,518 --> 00:17:03,052
I feel like we saw each other...

233
00:17:03,086 --> 00:17:04,788
like a few years ago, right?

234
00:17:04,822 --> 00:17:06,389
No, because...

235
00:17:06,422 --> 00:17:08,692
we haven't
seen each other since...

236
00:17:08,726 --> 00:17:09,760
college.

237
00:17:09,793 --> 00:17:11,194
Ah.

238
00:17:11,227 --> 00:17:14,532
Maybe I was just
thinking about you.

239
00:17:14,565 --> 00:17:16,700
Well, I'm really glad
I ran into you.

240
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:18,368
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

241
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:20,538
Your father's appeal
is tomorrow, right?

242
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:23,273
Yeah. How...

243
00:17:23,306 --> 00:17:24,808
Sorry, how do
you know about that?

244
00:17:24,842 --> 00:17:26,810
I'm covering it for the paper.

245
00:17:26,844 --> 00:17:27,745
Oh.

246
00:17:27,778 --> 00:17:29,479
How is he holding up?

247
00:17:30,614 --> 00:17:31,815
Um...

248
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:33,517
Are you asking for the paper?

249
00:17:33,551 --> 00:17:35,719
- No, I'm asking as a friend.
- Oh.

250
00:17:35,753 --> 00:17:38,622
Although I'm sure the public
would want to know as well.

251
00:17:41,491 --> 00:17:43,159
Well...

252
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:45,428
my only official comment
is that my dad is innocent.

253
00:17:45,461 --> 00:17:46,429
Right.

254
00:17:46,462 --> 00:17:48,398
I mean, no one...

255
00:17:48,431 --> 00:17:51,134
would want to believe that
their father killed their mother.

256
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:54,237
What do you mean, "believe"?
My dad shouldn't be in jail.

257
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,640
My mom should be alive.
It's not about what I believe.

258
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:59,710
- It's about what the truth is.
- Right. No, yes, that's...

259
00:17:59,743 --> 00:18:01,344
Oh, my God.
That's what I meant.

260
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:03,581
Right.

261
00:18:03,614 --> 00:18:05,481
Sorry,
I have no official comment at this time.

262
00:18:30,206 --> 00:18:31,585
<i>You have a collect call</i>

263
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:32,919
<i>from the
Iron Heights Penitentiary.</i>

264
00:18:32,943 --> 00:18:36,346
<i>- Do you wish to accept?</i>
- Yes.

265
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:38,381
- Hey, Dad.
<i>- Hey, Barry.</i>

266
00:18:38,414 --> 00:18:40,183
<i>- How ya doing?</i>
- I'm fine.

267
00:18:40,216 --> 00:18:42,318
<i>- You getting out much?</i>
- Yeah.

268
00:18:42,352 --> 00:18:44,822
<i>Well, no. Uh, no.</i>

269
00:18:44,855 --> 00:18:47,925
But I, um, I ran into
an old college friend...

270
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,760
Iris West, today.

271
00:18:49,793 --> 00:18:51,862
Didn't you have
a monster crush on her?

272
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:53,530
<i>Well, she have a boyfriend?</i>

273
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:57,300
<i>- Why don't you ask her out?</i>
- Dad, I, um...

274
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:01,337
I had a friend run the old security
camera footage from the store...

275
00:19:01,371 --> 00:19:03,807
through this new program
he's developed.

276
00:19:03,841 --> 00:19:06,376
And it's crystal clear now.

277
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:07,410
It's just...

278
00:19:09,445 --> 00:19:10,514
you never look up, Dad.

279
00:19:11,815 --> 00:19:13,917
You can't see your face.

280
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:17,688
<i>So, without new evidence
to support your alibi...</i>

281
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:20,356
<i>we're just gonna need to start
thinking about the next appeal.</i>

282
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,426
No, uh-uh. You need to stop
worrying about your old man.

283
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:27,607
<i>Do that, you might actually
have time for a girlfriend.</i>

284
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:29,733
But Dad, I don't want...

285
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,300
<i>We've done this before.</i>

286
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:32,703
This was a last-ditch effort...

287
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:35,539
and we'll go through
the motions tomorrow.

288
00:19:35,572 --> 00:19:37,775
<i>I'm okay, really.</i>

289
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:41,444
You know, sometimes I even think
it's probably easier for me to be in here

290
00:19:41,477 --> 00:19:42,546
than out there...

291
00:19:43,547 --> 00:19:45,783
without her.

292
00:19:45,816 --> 00:19:48,886
<i>'Cause this way,
I can imagine she's alive...</i>

293
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:50,688
out there living her life.

294
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:54,792
<i>Barry?</i>

295
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:57,325
<i>Barry?</i>

296
00:19:58,327 --> 00:19:59,730
<i>You there?</i>

297
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:01,464
Yeah, I'm here, Dad.

298
00:20:01,497 --> 00:20:04,935
Hey, remember that sauce
she'd make on Sundays?

299
00:20:04,968 --> 00:20:08,839
<i>The whole house would
smell like basil, tomatoes.</i>

300
00:20:08,872 --> 00:20:11,474
<i>And she'd put on my sweats
and start singing.</i>

301
00:20:13,844 --> 00:20:15,579
Yeah, what was that song?

302
00:20:15,612 --> 00:20:17,380
<i>I loved that song.</i>

303
00:20:17,413 --> 00:20:18,649
Remember that part.

304
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,622
It's not fair.

305
00:20:25,656 --> 00:20:27,356
What's not fair, Monkey?

306
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,660
This question is stupid.

307
00:20:29,693 --> 00:20:32,796
How many calculations can
you think of with an answer of 24?

308
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,497
There are a bajillion answers.

309
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:36,499
How am I supposed
to fit them all?

310
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:39,503
You are right. There are a
bajillion answers to this question.

311
00:20:39,536 --> 00:20:41,872
Not every problem
has a solution.

312
00:20:41,905 --> 00:20:43,640
Sometimes you just
have to let go.

313
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:47,929
Give your brain a rest and help
me make the pasta. Come on.

314
00:20:50,446 --> 00:20:51,815
No.

315
00:20:51,849 --> 00:20:52,850
Henry?

316
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:55,953
I need you to do me a favor.

317
00:20:55,986 --> 00:20:58,287
- I don't do favors.
- Okay.

318
00:20:58,321 --> 00:20:59,957
Barry needs you
to do him a favor.

319
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,693
Oh, Barry! Yeah, anything.

320
00:21:02,726 --> 00:21:04,661
I need another can of tomatoes.

321
00:21:05,696 --> 00:21:06,830
You have a can of tomatoes.

322
00:21:06,864 --> 00:21:08,565
I need another one.

323
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,442
I thought you guys
went to the store this morning.

324
00:21:10,466 --> 00:21:12,368
But I forgot the tomatoes.

325
00:21:13,771 --> 00:21:15,038
This looks way more fun.

326
00:21:15,072 --> 00:21:17,074
Let's just let
Barry go to the store.

327
00:21:17,107 --> 00:21:18,742
You drive, right, Squirm?

328
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:20,077
- What? No.
- Getting so big.

329
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,378
You can do anything.
Look at ya.

330
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:23,881
You're getting gray, actually.

331
00:21:23,914 --> 00:21:26,415
- Green can, not the blue one, okay?
- Got it.

332
00:21:26,449 --> 00:21:28,317
Blue can,
not the green one, right?

333
00:21:28,351 --> 00:21:30,486
- No! Green can, not the blue one.
- What?

334
00:21:32,388 --> 00:21:33,489
Oh, God.

335
00:21:35,391 --> 00:21:37,628
She's gonna start singing. Run!

336
00:21:38,562 --> 00:21:39,797
Run, Barry!

337
00:21:58,148 --> 00:21:59,116
I love you, Monkey.

338
00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:00,951
I love you more.

339
00:22:00,984 --> 00:22:02,485
I loved you first.

340
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,870
Nora?

341
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:24,608
Barry!

342
00:22:31,648 --> 00:22:33,951
Barry! Barry!

343
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,886
Call 911 now!

344
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:47,931
<i>Barry?</i>

345
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,100
<i>Barry?</i>

346
00:22:50,133 --> 00:22:52,069
<i>Don't worry about tomorrow.</i>

347
00:22:52,102 --> 00:22:53,770
<i>We always knew
it was a long shot...</i>

348
00:22:54,872 --> 00:22:57,440
Dad?

349
00:22:57,473 --> 00:23:00,878
<i>Your call with Iron
Heights Penitentiary has been terminated.</i>

350
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,019
<i>Barry Allen?</i>

351
00:24:51,955 --> 00:24:54,057
<i>Evidence our lab...</i>

352
00:24:54,091 --> 00:24:55,792
<i>You need to focus your motion.</i>

353
00:24:55,826 --> 00:24:56,893
<i>Do the work...</i>

354
00:24:59,796 --> 00:25:01,497
<i>She promised...</i>

355
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,138
<i>Now, was that
fast enough for you?</i>

356
00:25:47,677 --> 00:25:50,047
So, you're saying
you went back in time?

357
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,682
- Mm-hmm.
- Like in Pozharnov?

358
00:25:52,716 --> 00:25:54,027
Yeah, like in Pozharnov, except,
but Pozharnov was a second.

359
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:55,652
This time
I went back a whole day.

360
00:25:55,685 --> 00:25:57,087
So, let's imagine...

361
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,856
that it is, in fact, possible
for you to run...

362
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,324
faster than
the speed of light...

363
00:26:01,358 --> 00:26:03,727
and in so doing,
travel back in time.

364
00:26:05,028 --> 00:26:06,063
It still would be...

365
00:26:06,096 --> 00:26:08,331
wildly irresponsible.

366
00:26:08,365 --> 00:26:10,167
I knew you were gonna say this.

367
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,211
Yes, because, Barry,
if you were to go into the past,

368
00:26:12,235 --> 00:26:15,105
any interaction you have
with your parents or yourself,

369
00:26:15,138 --> 00:26:16,940
you step on
the wrong blade of grass,

370
00:26:16,973 --> 00:26:19,376
you have no idea what the
consequences to that could be.

371
00:26:19,409 --> 00:26:21,611
No, I know.
The butterfly effect, right?

372
00:26:21,645 --> 00:26:23,680
- Yes.
- I get it. But Bruce...

373
00:26:23,713 --> 00:26:25,115
I could fix things.

374
00:26:25,148 --> 00:26:28,785
You could
also destroy everything.

375
00:26:28,819 --> 00:26:30,921
I could save her.

376
00:26:30,954 --> 00:26:32,956
I could save both of them. I...

377
00:26:35,258 --> 00:26:36,626
I could save your parents.

378
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:40,397
Barry, these scars we have...

379
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,799
make us who we are.

380
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:46,403
We're not meant
to go back and fix them.

381
00:26:46,436 --> 00:26:49,639
And there's nothing broken
with you that needs to be fixed.

382
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:54,211
Take it from an old guy
who's made a lot of mistakes.

383
00:26:55,112 --> 00:26:56,313
Don't live your past.

384
00:26:57,814 --> 00:26:59,816
Live your life.

385
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,985
Don't let your tragedy
define you.

386
00:27:02,018 --> 00:27:03,720
What if it's supposed
to define me?

387
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,257
Your tragedy made you a hero.

388
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:10,026
And also made me alone.

389
00:27:12,762 --> 00:27:14,831
We could hang out.

390
00:27:14,865 --> 00:27:16,233
I mean, do you wanna get a bite?

391
00:27:16,266 --> 00:27:18,201
Like, I'm still hungry.

392
00:27:20,003 --> 00:27:21,004
Not this time.

393
00:27:22,739 --> 00:27:24,007
Maybe some other time.

394
00:27:26,443 --> 00:27:27,644
Yeah.

395
00:27:38,321 --> 00:27:39,689
Nice ride.

396
00:27:40,457 --> 00:27:42,692
You have fancy friends.

397
00:27:42,726 --> 00:27:44,127
Yeah, it was an Uber.

398
00:27:44,828 --> 00:27:46,863
Exec.

399
00:27:46,897 --> 00:27:48,875
Look, Iris, I really can't
talk about the case at all.

400
00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:51,101
I'm not here as a reporter.

401
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:54,070
Can we talk?

402
00:27:59,276 --> 00:28:00,977
Come on in.

403
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:09,386
I'm not gonna lie. It's a lot
tidier in here than I expected.

404
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:11,755
- Yeah? Yeah, well, um...
- Yeah.

405
00:28:11,788 --> 00:28:14,024
I'm a pretty tidy person.

406
00:28:18,995 --> 00:28:20,730
- Can I offer you a drink?
- Sure.

407
00:28:20,764 --> 00:28:21,765
I'll take a beer.

408
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:24,833
Hmm.

409
00:28:36,913 --> 00:28:38,315
Beers, beers, beers.

410
00:28:38,348 --> 00:28:40,083
I keep 'em in my fridge.

411
00:28:40,116 --> 00:28:41,116
Thanks.

412
00:28:41,484 --> 00:28:42,485
Sure.

413
00:28:44,087 --> 00:28:46,456
Look, I feel really bad

414
00:28:46,489 --> 00:28:47,891
about earlier.

415
00:28:52,896 --> 00:28:55,966
I should've been more sensitive.

416
00:28:55,999 --> 00:29:00,036
And, um, I probably
could've been less sensitive.

417
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,472
I mean, I can't imagine
what you've been through.

418
00:29:02,506 --> 00:29:05,242
It's like you lost
both parents in one day.

419
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:07,477
I did.

420
00:29:07,511 --> 00:29:09,379
I lost my mom to a tragedy,

421
00:29:09,412 --> 00:29:12,449
and I lost my dad to the
failures of the justice system.

422
00:29:12,482 --> 00:29:15,252
Is that why you got
into criminal forensics?

423
00:29:15,285 --> 00:29:16,486
To try and fix the system?

424
00:29:19,856 --> 00:29:21,391
Yeah.

425
00:29:21,424 --> 00:29:22,526
Yeah, to fix it.

426
00:29:24,427 --> 00:29:26,296
There's gotta be a way
to fix it, right?

427
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:29,099
I mean, that's kinda why
I got into journalism, too.

428
00:29:29,132 --> 00:29:31,401
I could make it right if I
could just go back somehow

429
00:29:31,434 --> 00:29:34,437
and warn them without them
knowing that I'd warned them.

430
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:36,906
I... thinking like that's
gonna...

431
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,475
Drive you crazy.

432
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:40,277
"If I could just
go back in time...

433
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,245
"and stop the guy
who did it." It's...

434
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:44,639
No, I can't do that,
'cause that's way too much interaction.

435
00:29:46,983 --> 00:29:48,385
My dad wasn't even at home.

436
00:29:48,418 --> 00:29:50,820
My mom sent him
to go get a can of tomatoes.

437
00:29:50,854 --> 00:29:53,099
I think whoever broke into
the house thought it was empty.

438
00:29:53,123 --> 00:29:55,234
And then my mom was in there
with the knife in her hand

439
00:29:55,258 --> 00:29:57,294
and things went bad,
just this absurd

440
00:29:57,327 --> 00:29:59,429
chain of events.

441
00:29:59,462 --> 00:30:02,332
And it's like, this footage should've
finally supported my dad's alibi.

442
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:03,900
But instead...

443
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:06,403
three lives ruined
for a can of tomatoes.

444
00:30:13,443 --> 00:30:14,443
Oh, my God.

445
00:30:15,078 --> 00:30:16,078
What?

446
00:30:17,314 --> 00:30:19,215
Well, that could be it.

447
00:30:19,249 --> 00:30:20,993
If my mom doesn't forget
the tomatoes in the first place,

448
00:30:21,017 --> 00:30:23,219
then he never leaves
and she never dies.

449
00:30:23,253 --> 00:30:26,022
No one would even
have to see me.

450
00:30:26,056 --> 00:30:27,501
Bruce said no interaction.
This is no interaction.

451
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,192
This is just quick in,
quick out,

452
00:30:29,225 --> 00:30:30,537
back to the present,
like I was never even there.

453
00:30:30,561 --> 00:30:32,395
That's how I fix it.
Oh, my God, Iris.

454
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:34,064
- Hmm?
- Thank you, so much.

455
00:30:34,097 --> 00:30:35,365
- This has been great.
- Oh.

456
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:37,267
Um... I'm sorry.

457
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,103
I... I have to leave.

458
00:30:40,136 --> 00:30:41,271
Okay. Right.

459
00:30:41,304 --> 00:30:43,541
Uh...

460
00:30:43,574 --> 00:30:46,309
I had a really great time,
by the way. We should do this again.

461
00:31:00,957 --> 00:31:04,027
<i>Kal-El, son of Krypton.</i>

462
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,596
<i>This is a bad idea.</i>

463
00:31:12,335 --> 00:31:13,403
<i>So, you're fast.</i>

464
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:19,510
<i>Your dad's a murderer.
Your dad's a murderer.</i>

465
00:31:22,145 --> 00:31:25,549
<i>Call 911 now!</i>

466
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,884

467
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,353
<i>Now!</i>

468
00:31:30,387 --> 00:31:31,589
<i>Now!</i>

469
00:32:24,007 --> 00:32:25,007
Hi, Mom.

470
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,289
Don't forget the tomatoes.

471
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:42,959
See you soon.

472
00:32:50,266 --> 00:32:51,267
Please work.

473
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:02,513

474
00:33:02,546 --> 00:33:05,348

00:33:11,555 --> 00:33:14,190

478
00:34:26,462 --> 00:34:28,732
Monkey!

479
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:31,769
What are you wearing?

480
00:34:31,802 --> 00:34:34,805
Is that Barry?
And he's early?

481
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:36,674
What universe is this?

482
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:38,642
You've cut your hair.

483
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:41,411
Now you can see your eyes.

484
00:34:41,444 --> 00:34:43,279
- You look terrible.
- Henry!

485
00:34:43,313 --> 00:34:44,658
- You look old.
- You look beautiful, baby.

486
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:46,517
What are they doing to you
over there?

487
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,819
Leave him alone. He's perfect.

488
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,655
Come here.

489
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,458
I love you so much.

490
00:34:55,491 --> 00:34:57,493
I love you, too.

491
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:58,529
I love you more.

492
00:34:58,562 --> 00:35:00,798
I loved you first.

493
00:35:00,831 --> 00:35:02,566
Go take a shower and change.

494
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,201
You smell like a boot.
Go, go, go.

495
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:09,472
"Old," seriously?

496
00:35:09,506 --> 00:35:11,240
Well, no, I mean like mature.

497
00:35:11,274 --> 00:35:13,242
He's at that age,
he wants to look old.

498
00:35:13,276 --> 00:35:15,546
He, you know,
gets into bars that way.

499
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:17,180
How can I help?

500
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:25,522
Mm. Hey, Mom,
how was your day?

501
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:27,558
How was your month,
or your last 18 years?

502
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:28,926
Or that's a weird question...

503
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:30,561
'cause I was here.

504
00:35:30,594 --> 00:35:33,363
But obviously, we share
those memories together.

505
00:35:33,396 --> 00:35:35,240
Or I don't know,
maybe we could make some new memories.

506
00:35:35,264 --> 00:35:36,943
Like we could go to the aquarium,
or the circus,

507
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:38,869
or to the park and you
could push me on a swing.

508
00:35:38,902 --> 00:35:40,804
That's also weird
because I'm an adult now,

509
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:43,172
so I'd probably motivate
my own motion on a swing.

510
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:44,726
So, how was it this week?
How's school?

511
00:35:46,476 --> 00:35:49,747
At school was... is good.

512
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,447
- Mm.
- School's been great.

513
00:35:51,481 --> 00:35:54,283
I've just been working
really hard there on my...

514
00:35:54,317 --> 00:35:55,586
studies.

515
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:57,320
Did you ask out
that girl from econ?

516
00:35:57,353 --> 00:35:59,723
I know freshman year is about

517
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:02,291
going out, meeting people, okay?

518
00:36:02,325 --> 00:36:03,393
Exploring things.

519
00:36:03,994 --> 00:36:05,696
Experimenting.

520
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,867
But you have to be very careful.

521
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,901
Oh, shit.

522
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:14,237
I... have to shit.

523
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:16,807
Outside.

524
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,782
Help!

525
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:26,482
Shh! Why are you here?

526
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,517
What year is it?

527
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,621
- No, no, no.
- Help!

528
00:36:36,259 --> 00:36:37,895
That's my face.

529
00:36:37,928 --> 00:36:40,363
You stole my face.

530
00:36:40,396 --> 00:36:41,875
Think I'm having
a mushroom flashback?

531
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,801
- Is that a thing?
- How old are you?

532
00:36:45,368 --> 00:36:46,369
Eighteen.

533
00:36:55,445 --> 00:36:56,680
Whoa.

534
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,315
This is mad trippy.

535
00:36:59,348 --> 00:37:00,751
So, we're, like, in the future.

536
00:37:00,784 --> 00:37:03,252
No, wait.
This is not trippy, dude.

537
00:37:03,286 --> 00:37:05,455
This is catastrophic.

538
00:37:05,488 --> 00:37:07,534
And no, we're not in the future. I was
supposed to be back in the present,

539
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,859
but I'm still in the past.

540
00:37:08,892 --> 00:37:10,928
And there's not
supposed to be two of me.

541
00:37:10,961 --> 00:37:13,338
You and I are not supposed to
be occupying the same reality at all,

542
00:37:13,362 --> 00:37:15,264
let alone interacting.

543
00:37:15,298 --> 00:37:17,276
I just can't believe I'm a
superhero who time travels...

544
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,037
No, no, no.
You are not anything.

545
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,673
Which is good. You don't want
to be a superhero. It's scary.

546
00:37:22,706 --> 00:37:26,275
And I get bug splatter
in my teeth all the time.

547
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,344
Awesome.

548
00:37:28,377 --> 00:37:29,980
Hey, do the thing again.

549
00:37:30,013 --> 00:37:31,247
No, we don't have time.

550
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:35,384
- Mom!
- Shh!

551
00:37:35,418 --> 00:37:37,138
What are you doing?
You're gonna tattle now?

552
00:37:37,821 --> 00:37:39,422
- Do the thing.
- Fine.

553
00:37:44,828 --> 00:37:46,663
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Happy?

554
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:47,698
Now undo it.

555
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,281
I can't, I can't.

556
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:07,416
Ow.

557
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,853
Barry, are you okay up there?

558
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:11,522
We're fine! I'm fine!

559
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:13,056
Okay, Monkey.

560
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,793
So, do you have like a plane
that goes underwater?

561
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:18,529
Or like a boat that can fly?

562
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:19,696
How old are you, like 40?

563
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,765
Okay, you don't stop talking.

564
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,868
It's not charming.
It's abrasive and exhausting.

565
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:27,838
And, oh, my God. I am starting
to realize what people mean.

566
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:29,338
Just...

567
00:38:29,372 --> 00:38:31,407
do me a favor

568
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,011
and promise me that meeting me
isn't gonna screw up space-time.

569
00:38:34,711 --> 00:38:35,813
Broski...

570
00:38:36,613 --> 00:38:37,781
I got you.

571
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,082
Shit, I'm in so much trouble.

572
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:40,383
What do you mean?

573
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:42,619
What do I do?

574
00:38:43,687 --> 00:38:45,421
I could drug you.

575
00:38:45,454 --> 00:38:46,690
Yeah, I could drug you,

576
00:38:46,723 --> 00:38:48,067
and then you'd pass out,
you'd wake up

577
00:38:48,091 --> 00:38:49,927
and you'd forget
that anything ever happened.

578
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,403
And it wouldn't be wrong,
right? Because you're me.

579
00:38:51,427 --> 00:38:53,396
No! I mean, we shouldn't.

580
00:38:53,429 --> 00:38:55,398
- Please don't... drug me.
- No.

581
00:38:55,431 --> 00:38:57,043
No. Because here's the thing,
and I thought about it before.

582
00:38:57,067 --> 00:38:58,702
I don't want to be drugged.

583
00:38:58,735 --> 00:39:01,772
But I'm sure
we can think of another way.

584
00:39:01,805 --> 00:39:03,372
Let's put on
our Barry thinking caps

585
00:39:03,406 --> 00:39:05,374
and think of
a different solution

586
00:39:05,408 --> 00:39:06,743
for memory loss.

587
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:08,712
Also, I'm a green belt...

588
00:39:08,745 --> 00:39:10,113
in the Capoeira,

589
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:12,381
and I have
extensively studied wrestler,

590
00:39:12,415 --> 00:39:14,952
and I could just go
frickin' lunatic on you.

591
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:16,265
Besides,
I have a date tonight...

592
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,390
Okay.

593
00:39:21,424 --> 00:39:23,468
How hard do you have to hit
someone to make them forget stuff?

594
00:39:23,492 --> 00:39:26,029
If I hit you in the past,
will it hurt me in the future?

595
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:27,898
Wait. You say
you have a date tonight?

596
00:39:27,931 --> 00:39:29,666
Yeah. Wait,
what were you doing?

597
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,635
Uh, nothing.
Who's your date with?

598
00:39:31,668 --> 00:39:34,671
This super babe
in my econ class.

599
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,840
- Iris West?
- Oh, my God!

600
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,141
Do we marry her?

601
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:39,910
You're going on
a date with her tonight?

602
00:39:39,943 --> 00:39:41,612
That's why
I need Mom to do my laundry.

603
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:43,547
You don't even
do your own laundry?

604
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,580
Do you?

605
00:39:45,048 --> 00:39:46,917
Okay.

606
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,752
- I'm actually gonna go.
- What do you mean?

607
00:39:48,785 --> 00:39:50,621
Enjoy your life. Do you.

608
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,756
Change literally nothing.

609
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:55,034
- Um, I'll see you again never.
- I have a few more questions, though.

610
00:39:55,058 --> 00:39:56,994
We have so much
to learn from each other.

611
00:39:58,494 --> 00:39:59,529
Oh, great.

612
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,898
Well, you're leaving me.

613
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:02,866
And now the storm's
gonna ruin my date.

614
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,002
What day is it today?

615
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:08,805
Uh... Uh...

616
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:10,841
Sunday?

617
00:40:10,874 --> 00:40:11,874
No, the date.

618
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:15,478
It's September 29th.

619
00:40:16,513 --> 00:40:17,513
Shit.

620
00:40:18,481 --> 00:40:21,051
This storm, this is the day.

621
00:40:21,084 --> 00:40:23,620
- What day?
- The day I got my powers.

622
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:25,789
The day you get your powers.

623
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:28,592
- Powers?
- Listen...

624
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,236
I can't tell you why
I traveled back in time,

625
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,930
and I can't tell you
what I changed.

626
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:35,632
But, essentially,
in my version of reality,

627
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,734
I ended up interning
at the Central City Crime Lab

628
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,504
in my freshman year,
and that's where it happened.

629
00:40:40,537 --> 00:40:42,239
Well, happens.

630
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:44,942
Tonight, September 29,
the accident that gives me my powers.

631
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:46,677
And if you're not there...

632
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:48,679
in 30 minutes...

633
00:40:50,213 --> 00:40:51,782
then you won't get the powers.

634
00:40:51,815 --> 00:40:54,651
Which means
I don't get the powers, maybe?

635
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:57,688
And then, that would mean
that I lose my way

636
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,690
of getting back in time
in the first place,

637
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,758
and then I literally
have no idea what happens.

638
00:41:02,592 --> 00:41:03,760
Powers?

639
00:41:07,664 --> 00:41:09,166
Wait, but what about
our date tonight?

640
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:12,069
She might be our future wife.

641
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:14,972
There might not be a future...

642
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:16,840
if you don't come with me...

643
00:41:16,873 --> 00:41:17,941
right now.

644
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:26,249
Eight minutes.

645
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,227
How are we gonna to get inside?
What are you doing?

646
00:41:28,251 --> 00:41:29,653
Would you stop whining?

647
00:41:29,686 --> 00:41:32,055
This is gonna feel kinda weird.

648
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,180
We walk through the door.

649
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:00,584
Yes, it's okay.
It's called phasing.

650
00:42:00,617 --> 00:42:01,685
Come on.

651
00:42:04,354 --> 00:42:05,789
I love phasing.

652
00:42:08,825 --> 00:42:09,825
Uh-huh.

653
00:42:10,994 --> 00:42:12,996
Everybody moves.

654
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,889
Well... this is it.

655
00:42:38,922 --> 00:42:40,957
This is where I was sitting.

656
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,193
And actually,
let me take this for you.

657
00:42:43,226 --> 00:42:44,694
Thank you.

658
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,830
Okay, I had just
opened those windows...

659
00:42:48,765 --> 00:42:50,700
to clear out the fumes.

660
00:42:51,768 --> 00:42:52,903
Right around now.

661
00:42:52,936 --> 00:42:54,871
And I was sitting in that chair,

662
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,740
and I was right under
this shelf of chemicals.

663
00:42:56,773 --> 00:42:58,775
And that's when
the lightning hits.

664
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:00,010
Wait.

665
00:43:00,043 --> 00:43:01,645
- I get hit by lightning?
- No, no, no.

666
00:43:01,678 --> 00:43:03,080
You don't get hit by lightning.

667
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:04,390
Okay, 'cause for a second
I thought you said...

668
00:43:04,414 --> 00:43:05,882
The lightning
hits the chemicals...

669
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,617
which then you get bathed in,

670
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:09,386
- and that's what electrocutes you.
- Okay,

671
00:43:09,419 --> 00:43:11,230
- but I don't want to be electrocuted, though.
- Sit down.

672
00:43:11,254 --> 00:43:13,390
- No, you sit down.
- I already have the powers!

673
00:43:13,423 --> 00:43:14,691
You already have the powers!

674
00:43:14,724 --> 00:43:15,926
Exactly!

675
00:43:15,959 --> 00:43:17,694
I am not getting
struck by lightning!

676
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:58,701
It worked.

677
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:08,712
It looks like you lost a tooth.

678
00:44:11,948 --> 00:44:14,017
Oh.

679
00:44:15,051 --> 00:44:16,887
- No?
- You lost a tooth.

680
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:30,300
All right. We gotta go.

681
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:35,805
What have we got?

682
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,383
The alarms in the sterile lab.

683
00:44:37,407 --> 00:44:38,408
Go check it.

684
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,414
Securing the entrance.

685
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:49,753
We've gotta phase.

686
00:44:49,786 --> 00:44:51,121
Phase, phasing.

687
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:15,879
Oh...

688
00:45:36,866 --> 00:45:37,901
Shit!

689
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,773
I'm slow.

690
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:47,010
Oh. Oh.

691
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:53,450
Why is your place so much nicer

692
00:45:53,483 --> 00:45:55,529
- than I expected it to be?
- You like it?

693
00:45:55,553 --> 00:45:57,555
Mom had to help decorate.

694
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:58,922
You know Mom.

695
00:45:58,955 --> 00:46:01,324
Right, yeah. Classic Mom.

696
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:02,358
Classic Mom.

697
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,263
Hmm.

698
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,434
- What a day.
- Barry,

699
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:12,969
the accident gave you powers,

700
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:14,505
but took mine away.

701
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:16,806
So, I don't know how I get back.

702
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,150
Without access
to the Speed Force,

703
00:46:18,174 --> 00:46:20,877
I don't know how I ever leave.

704
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:23,013
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

705
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:25,115
- I might be stuck.
- Wait.

706
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:27,784
I have powers now?

707
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:29,953
Yeah, but...

708
00:46:29,986 --> 00:46:31,321
you... No, no, no.

709
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,070
Holy speed balls.

710
00:46:47,103 --> 00:46:49,272
Okay, I know
this is incredibly exciting,

711
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,508
because I went through it.

712
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:51,975
Speedy Gonzales!

713
00:46:52,008 --> 00:46:54,110
Yes, I've done it
many times myself.

714
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,079
You can't just start...

715
00:46:57,113 --> 00:46:58,516
Shit.

716
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,352

Oh, my...

00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:48,631
Ahh!

726
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:12,155
Okay, I'm leaving!

727
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:24,033
<i>Put your hands up.</i>

728
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,184
What did you do?

729
00:48:41,217 --> 00:48:43,119
Nothing. Why?

730
00:48:49,225 --> 00:48:51,094
Barry...

731
00:48:51,127 --> 00:48:53,005
I could've told you about
the clothes. It's friction.

732
00:48:53,029 --> 00:48:55,141
You run too fast,
and regular fabrics are gonna burn up.

733
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:58,034
It's the same reason why you can't
move people very far at hyperspeed.

734
00:48:58,067 --> 00:48:59,603
That broccoli looks rotten.

735
00:48:59,637 --> 00:49:01,237
Look, some things you can move.

736
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,972
Like, you can move,

737
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:05,375
for instance, a microwave.

738
00:49:05,408 --> 00:49:07,611
But you can't move
something like, say...

739
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:09,145
- a baby.
- Barry,

740
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:10,724
it's like I've never eaten
anything before.

741
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:14,484
Everything has this
vivid flavor. Try a little.

742
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:16,386
Just take a little bite.

743
00:49:16,419 --> 00:49:18,188
That's bad, isn't it?

744
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:19,533
Yeah,
this is not good. No, I was kidding.

745
00:49:19,557 --> 00:49:21,357
I'm amazing. We're amazing.

746
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:23,359
I'm so hungry.

747
00:49:24,562 --> 00:49:26,196
Hey, wait.

748
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:28,264
I wanna try that phasing thing.
How do I do that?

749
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,333
You don't. Not yet.

750
00:49:30,366 --> 00:49:32,268
Okay? It's very complicated.

751
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,705
Takes a long time to train
your body to be able to speed up

752
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:36,683
whilst your molecules slow
down enough to pass through

753
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:38,709
the molecular structure
of solid objects...

754
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,213
Get out of here!

755
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,355
You've gotta start letting me
finish my sentences.

756
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:55,358
Are we always this sleepy?

757
00:49:55,391 --> 00:49:57,695
And hungry and naked?

758
00:49:57,728 --> 00:49:59,630
Well, the first two, yes.

759
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:02,232
The third one, no.
I've figured that part out.

760
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:03,801
And honestly,
if we're gonna do this

761
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,803
there's a lot I'm gonna have to
explain to you.

762
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,371
So, a good place to start,
I guess,

763
00:50:08,404 --> 00:50:11,207
is that, yeah, the original suit

764
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,441
was actually made out of this polysynth...

765
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:15,613
Or we'll

766
00:50:15,646 --> 00:50:17,548
pick this up tomorrow.

767
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:19,291
So, the suit is inside the ring?

768
00:50:19,315 --> 00:50:21,351
- Yeah.
- What?

769
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:23,721
And I can have this?

770
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:25,756
No, you can't have it.
You can borrow it

771
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:27,591
so you don't kill yourself
using your powers.

772
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:31,194
You're gonna push this button

773
00:50:31,227 --> 00:50:32,672
and the silk molecules are gonna uncoil,
absorbing atmospheric gases

774
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,497
and expanding the suit
to full size.

775
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:35,666
Ready?

776
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:55,318
It was so tiny...

777
00:50:55,351 --> 00:50:57,396
You're supposed to put it on
before it hits the floor.

778
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,455
What, like change...

779
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:01,190
right here in front of you?

780
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,869
There's no one even
here anyway, Barry. Come on...

781
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,829
- Whoo, man.
- Tight.

782
00:51:07,163 --> 00:51:08,431
It hurts.

783
00:51:08,464 --> 00:51:09,867
You know where it hurts?

784
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,335
- In my dick.
- Okay. I know, I know,

785
00:51:12,368 --> 00:51:14,103
but I don't need to know.

786
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:16,205
- Sorry, can we move on?
- Mm-hmm.

787
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,741
Here's what I'm thinking.

788
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:19,743
If I can train you
to move like I do,

789
00:51:19,777 --> 00:51:21,277
then we can re-create
the Chronobowl.

790
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:22,312
Chronobowl?

791
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:23,313
In the Speed Force.

792
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:25,415
Speed Force?

793
00:51:25,448 --> 00:51:26,526
And then maybe we can find some
way to get me back to the future.

794
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,652
<i>Back to the Future.</i> Yes!

795
00:51:28,686 --> 00:51:30,253
Eric Stoltz

796
00:51:30,286 --> 00:51:32,690
is chur boy in that movie.

797
00:51:32,723 --> 00:51:34,625
What an embodied performance.

798
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:36,527
You mean Michael J. Fox?

799
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,629
<i>Back to the Future?</i>

800
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:40,782
- Yeah, in the movie <i>Back to the Future?</i>
- Oh, my God!

801
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,234
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

802
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:53,820
You need to
take the suit off now.

803
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:55,378
Thank God.

804
00:52:00,918 --> 00:52:02,862
<i>Reported seeing
a mysterious object</i>

805
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:05,522
<i>hovering above
the Australian seaboard.</i>

806
00:52:05,556 --> 00:52:07,691
<i>- We've obtained footage from the sighting...</i>
- Zod.

807
00:52:07,725 --> 00:52:09,803
<i>- And as you can see, the object...</i>
- "Zod"?

808
00:52:09,827 --> 00:52:12,930
<i>- Appears to be a flying ship of some sort.</i>
- What's a zod?

809
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,365
<i>According to
US government officials,</i>

810
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:16,934
<i>satellite data</i>

811
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,902
<i>has confirmed
the presence of a spacecraft.</i>

812
00:52:18,936 --> 00:52:20,804
<i>We'll be sure...</i>

813
00:52:24,273 --> 00:52:26,142
<i>My name is General Zod.</i>

814
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,513
<i>I come from a world</i>

815
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:31,414
<i>far from yours.</i>

816
00:52:31,447 --> 00:52:33,884
<i>For some time, your world</i>

817
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:37,655
<i>- has sheltered - one of my citizens.
- No,</i> no, no.

818
00:52:37,688 --> 00:52:40,232
- This can't be happening.
<i>- I request that - you return this individual...</i>

819
00:52:40,256 --> 00:52:41,859
- Not now.
<i>- To my custody.</i>

820
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:44,293
What's happening?

821
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,696
<i>For reasons unknown...</i>

822
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:47,430
Zod's looking for Superman.

823
00:52:47,463 --> 00:52:48,799
What's a superman?

824
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:52,912
Superman is an alien
who lives on Earth.

825
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:54,938
I'm assuming still incognito.

826
00:52:54,972 --> 00:52:58,207
But, yeah, he's an alien,
and he's very powerful,

827
00:52:58,241 --> 00:52:59,810
and he's just the best.

828
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:03,246
And then Zod is an alien
from the same planet,

829
00:53:03,279 --> 00:53:04,782
also very powerful,

830
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:06,215
but he's just the worst.

831
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:08,919
And Zod came here to find Clark.

832
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:11,855
- Wait, who's Clark?
- Clark is Superman.

833
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:13,957
- Oh. Okay.
- But then

834
00:53:13,991 --> 00:53:17,493
Zod also tried to terraform the
planet with this World Engine thing,

835
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:18,996
and Superman
stopped him eventually,

836
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:22,231
but not before Zod killed
thousands of people.

837
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:23,499
- Yeesh.
- And at the time,

838
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,669
there was
nothing I could do, I've...

839
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,374
Wait, you...

840
00:53:31,407 --> 00:53:32,475
You were there?

841
00:53:33,744 --> 00:53:36,245
Yeah, I had just
gotten my powers.

842
00:53:38,749 --> 00:53:41,250
<i>And I was still putting some
finishing touches on my suit.</i>

843
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:46,890
<i>This thing, Zod's World Engine,</i>

844
00:53:46,924 --> 00:53:49,526
<i>it started destroying Metropolis,
so I just went there</i>

845
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,261
<i>and I started
trying to save people.</i>

846
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,030
Daddy?

847
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:56,533
Listen to me!

848
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,267
Run away!

849
00:53:58,301 --> 00:53:59,301
Run away!

850
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:07,644
<i>There was this kid, and I...</i>

851
00:54:07,678 --> 00:54:09,780
<i>I got him, but then...</i>

852
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:11,347
<i>I couldn't get his dad.</i>

853
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:13,917
Daddy!

854
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:32,301
<i>It was all I could do,</i>

855
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:33,504
<i>save that one kid.</i>

856
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,406
Only Superman could stop Zod.

857
00:54:39,408 --> 00:54:41,444
But not in time
to save those people.

858
00:54:41,477 --> 00:54:43,013
And now
it's about to happen again.

859
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:44,982
But...

860
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:47,416
if I can find
the entire Justice League,

861
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,520
Superman and
the rest of the band...

862
00:54:49,553 --> 00:54:50,954
Right.

863
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:52,689
Then maybe I can prevent
the whole thing

864
00:54:52,723 --> 00:54:54,525
from ever even happening at all.

865
00:54:57,694 --> 00:55:00,030
- Um, give me your laptop.
- Okay.

866
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:01,464
What is that smell?

867
00:55:01,497 --> 00:55:02,966
Ugh. Could be anything.

868
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:04,967
Honestly.

869
00:55:06,435 --> 00:55:07,671
Who's that?

870
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:10,073
Oh. That's Gary.
That's the smell. It's...

871
00:55:10,107 --> 00:55:11,842
Don't worry. He's breezy.

872
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:15,579
We can do this.

873
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,848
Uh, let's see, Victor Stone,
Gotham City University.

874
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:22,686
Oh, this is my roommate, Patty.

875
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:23,620
Patty...

876
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:24,888
is your roommate?

877
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:27,624
And that's her boyfriend,
Albert.

878
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:28,959
What's up?

879
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,828
Good morning.

880
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,698
Oh, sorry. And, uh, guys...

881
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:37,034
This is my cousin.

882
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:38,701
Barry.

883
00:55:40,871 --> 00:55:41,871
Whoa.

884
00:55:44,575 --> 00:55:45,575
I'm starving.

885
00:55:49,445 --> 00:55:50,747
Okay.

886
00:55:50,781 --> 00:55:52,415
Victor Stone,
Gotham City University.

887
00:55:52,448 --> 00:55:54,117
Yes. Here he is.

888
00:55:54,151 --> 00:55:56,419
Victor Stone, star quarterback
for the Knight...

889
00:55:56,452 --> 00:55:57,721
Shit, okay.

890
00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:59,089
He's not Cyborg yet.

891
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:01,692
Wonder Woman.

892
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:02,960
Wonder Woman!

893
00:56:02,993 --> 00:56:05,629
Las Vegas residency.

894
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:08,065
Illusions, juggling, and zebras.

895
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:10,634
No. That is not Diana.

896
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:12,569
- Aquaman.
- Aquaman?

897
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:14,104
Is that like a super mermaid?

898
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:15,572
No, Albert,

899
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:17,040
he's not a super mermaid.

900
00:56:17,074 --> 00:56:19,475
Okay? He's half Atlantean,
half human

901
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:22,411
with superhuman strength who
can control marine life with his mind.

902
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:23,590
So, like a super mermaid?

903
00:56:23,614 --> 00:56:24,815
No, Albert!

904
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:26,683
That is what you described.

905
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,585
We'll just try Arthur Curry...

906
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:29,853
Maine...

907
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:32,723
lighthouse.

908
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:36,492
Here we are. Thomas Curry.
That's his dad.

909
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:37,526
Uh, phone.

910
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:40,463
Hello.

911
00:56:40,496 --> 00:56:42,498
<i>- Hello, Thomas Curry?
- Yes.</i>

912
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:43,967
Could I speak to Arthur?

913
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:45,502
Is Arthur around?

914
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:47,537
You wanna speak to my dog?

915
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:50,741
What? No, no. Um, sorry. Uh...

916
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:52,809
- Is this Thomas Curry?
<i>- Yes.</i>

917
00:56:52,843 --> 00:56:55,646
- And you work at a lighthouse?
<i>- Yes.</i>

918
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:57,814
Okay, and your wife is
the queen of Atlantis?

919
00:56:57,848 --> 00:57:00,248
<i>- Will you accept this rose?
- Yes.</i>

920
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,719
Uh, no.

921
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:04,554
Uh, right, but maybe, maybe...

922
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:06,990
um, a fish like woman

923
00:57:07,024 --> 00:57:09,492
washed into your life

924
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:11,595
- at some point or another?
<i>- Very funny, asshole.</i>

925
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:16,767
Arthur Curry was never born.

926
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,635
- What?
- This is a disaster.

927
00:57:18,669 --> 00:57:20,203
I-I-I completely
destroyed history.

928
00:57:20,237 --> 00:57:21,838
Like Eric Stoltz.

929
00:57:21,872 --> 00:57:23,516
Okay, why do you keep saying,
"Eric Stoltz"?

930
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,875
Eric Stoltz is Marty McFly.

931
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:26,209
- What?
- Time travel?

932
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:28,679
Oh. We talking "BTTF"?

933
00:57:28,712 --> 00:57:29,813
Come on, who is this guy?

934
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:31,214
Okay, yeah, no, I know.

935
00:57:31,248 --> 00:57:33,050
I've seen all of them

936
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:35,719
and Eric Stoltz
is not Marty McFly.

937
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:36,752
Really?

938
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:40,190
Then explain Marty McThigh here.

939
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:41,792
I can't explain that to you,
Gary.

940
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:43,627
That's not your thigh.

941
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,896
It's the wrong actor,
and it's upside down.

942
00:57:47,531 --> 00:57:48,966
Is it?

943
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:52,970
The point is that

944
00:57:53,003 --> 00:57:54,705
in <i>Back to the Future</i>

945
00:57:54,738 --> 00:57:58,075
Marty McFly is very famously
played by Michael J. Fox.

946
00:57:58,108 --> 00:57:59,543
The guy from <i>Footloose?</i>

947
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:01,111
No, that's Kevin Bacon!

948
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,980
- Bacon.
- Kevin Bacon's Maverick

949
00:58:03,013 --> 00:58:04,724
with the volleyball,
the gay guys, and the planes?

950
00:58:04,748 --> 00:58:06,683

951
00:58:06,717 --> 00:58:08,685

- No, no, no.

952
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:10,754
I completely broke the universe.

953
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:14,925
Marty McFly is Eric Stoltz.

954
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,994
- Yes.
- Thank you.

955
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:20,597
I created a world
with no met a humans.

956
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,866
And now there's no one
to defend us from Zod. Albert!

957
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:26,937
There's no Cyborg.

958
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:28,872
There's no Aquaman.
There's no Wonder Woman.

959
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:30,774
There's no Superman.

960
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:31,975
There's no Batman.

961
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:33,076
I'm Batman.

962
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:38,148
What, you...
What did you just say?

963
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,217
I'm Batman.

964
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:43,954
Batman exists?

965
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:45,131
- Hundo p.
- Yeah, dude.

966
00:58:45,155 --> 00:58:46,957
Nobody knows who he really is,

967
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:49,626
- but he exists.
- Right.

968
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:51,161
Well, uh, we...

969
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,929
my cousin Barry and I,

970
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:55,699
have to go
to that cousin's dinner.

971
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:57,300
Now.

972
00:58:57,334 --> 00:58:59,236
But it was a pleasure to meet

973
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:01,138
you all.

974
00:59:01,171 --> 00:59:03,740
- And Gary.
- Barry.

975
00:59:03,774 --> 00:59:05,008

976
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:06,043
Barry!

977
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:28,065
What, are you frickin'
kidding me with this place?

978
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:33,937
What is this, hell?

979
00:59:43,013 --> 00:59:44,214
It's open.

980
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:59,179

- Okay, Barry, don't touch anything in here.

981
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:05,168

Bruce?

991
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:48,988
Hey,
check this out. There's, like,

992
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:50,881
bells connected to every room
in this house.

993
01:00:50,914 --> 01:00:52,458
Hey, maybe we can
find this Bruce guy...

994
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,885
if we just ring
all these bells, right?

995
01:00:54,918 --> 01:00:57,830
You don't understand how servant
bells work? Those are all the bells.

996
01:00:57,854 --> 01:01:00,190
- You ring them from all the other places.
- What?

997
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:02,301
You don't have, like,
<i>Downton Abbey</i> in your universe?

998
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,027
Downtown Abbey's?

999

it's like cheaper Bananabee's.

you're the same person as him...

01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:46,429
- but from an alternate timeline.
- Yes.

1019
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:50,467

- Well, but you're a bit...

1022
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:57,841
you're, uh...

1023
01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:00,210
- chronologically different.
- Older.

1024
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:02,379
That's what I can't understand.

1025
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:05,382
I traveled back in time
from here to here.

1026
01:03:05,415 --> 01:03:08,318
Yet somehow,
everything's all changed

1027
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:10,287
back here.

1028
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,640
- Or like when you were born, so...
- Well...

1029
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:14,324
time isn't linear.

1030
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:15,559
Right?

1031
01:03:15,593 --> 01:03:16,593
Right.

1032
01:03:19,329 --> 01:03:20,564
At some point

1033
01:03:20,598 --> 01:03:24,000
you probably saw a movie
that told you

1034
01:03:24,034 --> 01:03:26,136
that if you went back
and changed the past,

1035
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:29,439
you'd create a kind of
a branched timeline, right?

1036
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:30,807
Like, look.

1037
01:03:34,077 --> 01:03:36,079

1038
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:38,582
- and new future.
- Yeah.

1039
01:03:38,616 --> 01:03:40,450
Well, time doesn't
work like that.

1040
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:41,918
That's not how time works.

1041
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:43,953
When you go back
and change the past

1042
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:46,022
you create a fulcrum.

1043
01:03:46,056 --> 01:03:48,992
You put yourself on a whole
nother strand of spaghetti.

1044
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:52,530
New future. New past.

1045
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:55,498
It's retrocausal.

1046
01:03:55,533 --> 01:03:56,966
It goes both ways.

1047
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,369
Actually, it goes many ways.

1048
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:01,338
Maybe some other time.

1049
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:04,908
Okay, but in an ontological paradox model,
there's not...

1050
01:04:04,941 --> 01:04:07,578
What you did was
you changed the future

1051
01:04:07,611 --> 01:04:08,912
and you changed the past.

1052
01:04:09,613 --> 01:04:10,614
If a person

1053
01:04:10,648 --> 01:04:13,016
is stupid enough

1054
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:14,451
to mess with time...

1055
01:04:14,484 --> 01:04:16,920
what you eventually
end up with is this.

1056
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:20,957
The multiverse.

1057
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:22,593
Some strands run

1058
01:04:22,626 --> 01:04:24,160
almost parallel.

1059
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:26,930
There will be
inevitable intersections,

1060
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:28,898
and others that are just...

1061
01:04:28,932 --> 01:04:30,568
wildly divergent.

1062
01:04:30,601 --> 01:04:31,601
What it is...

1063
01:04:33,236 --> 01:04:34,236
is a hot mess.

1064
01:04:35,706 --> 01:04:37,440
It's a crapshoot.

1065
01:04:37,474 --> 01:04:39,008
It's all just a crapshoot.

1066
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:40,377
What does the parmesan mean?

1067
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,312
The metaphor's over.
It's just a garnish.

1068
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:44,280
And I'll tell ya something.

1069
01:04:44,314 --> 01:04:45,949
A person would have to be

1070
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:47,917
an idiot

1071
01:04:47,951 --> 01:04:49,520
to play craps

1072
01:04:49,553 --> 01:04:51,454
with the space-time continuum.

1073
01:04:51,488 --> 01:04:53,123
Yeah, an idiot.

1074
01:04:54,658 --> 01:04:55,658
Here.

1075
01:04:57,961 --> 01:04:59,996
Mm.

1076
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:02,332
Are you joking with
the chewing noises right now?

1077
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:04,367
So, uh, you're the reason

1078
01:05:05,669 --> 01:05:07,103
this Zod character

1079
01:05:07,137 --> 01:05:09,406
is about to destroy the Earth?

1080
01:05:09,439 --> 01:05:10,473
Maybe.

1081
01:05:10,508 --> 01:05:12,342
There's a guy called Superman

1082
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:13,544
who can stop Zod?

1083
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:16,179
- Yeah, yeah.
- And flies?

1084
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:18,014
Shoots lasers out of his eyes?

1085
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:20,159
Yes, he flies, and he shoots
lasers out of his eyes. Yes.

1086
01:05:20,183 --> 01:05:21,384
No one said "Superman"...

1087
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:25,488
that might be
a little on the nose?

1088
01:05:25,523 --> 01:05:27,625
- You call yourself Batman.
- Yeah.

1089
01:05:27,658 --> 01:05:29,527
I don't call myself
Super Batman.

1090
01:05:31,461 --> 01:05:34,063
Wait, he's Batman?

1091
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:36,065
What did you think
we were doing here?

1092
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:38,234
I thought this was
the cousin's dinner.

1093
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:40,738
He's... Bruce Wayne is Batman?

1094
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:42,506
Not really.
Not so much anymore.

1095
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:44,441
You know...

1096
01:05:44,474 --> 01:05:45,942
they don't really need me.

1097
01:05:47,645 --> 01:05:50,079
Things have changed.
Gotham's now

1098
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:52,215
one of the safest cities
in the world.

1099
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:54,317
Well, I... I need you.
We need you.

1100
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:55,553
In my timeline,

1101
01:05:55,586 --> 01:05:57,755
Batman's our strategist,
our leader.

1102
01:05:57,788 --> 01:06:00,490
The world needs Superman.
You're the best detective in the world.

1103
01:06:00,524 --> 01:06:02,702
You're probably the only person
who can help me find him.

1104
01:06:02,726 --> 01:06:04,294
So, will you help us?

1105
01:06:05,729 --> 01:06:06,729
Pass.

1106
01:06:11,535 --> 01:06:13,269
Like pass the salt?

1107
01:06:14,204 --> 01:06:15,338
Bruce?

1108
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,275
He doesn't want to help us...

1109
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:21,010
we're gonna use his bat shit.

1110
01:06:21,044 --> 01:06:22,044
Bat shit?

1111
01:06:23,413 --> 01:06:25,683
Yeah, his bat stuff,
his bat things.

1112
01:06:25,716 --> 01:06:26,717
Stand on that thing.

1113
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:32,055
Okay, remember when you phased
through the floor?

1114
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:33,456
- Yeah.
- So,

1115
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,458
I need you to do that again.

1116
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:37,227
Ow.

1117
01:06:42,766 --> 01:06:44,367
What is this place?

1118
01:07:52,268 --> 01:07:53,804
Dude!

1119
01:07:53,837 --> 01:07:57,508
This place straight beeves!

1120
01:07:57,541 --> 01:07:59,108
"Beeves"?

1121
01:08:10,153 --> 01:08:11,154
Barry!

1122
01:08:11,889 --> 01:08:13,423
I almost died

1123
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:14,525
in an abyss!

1124
01:08:14,558 --> 01:08:18,161
12,805 Clark Kents in the US.

1125
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:19,697
Is this what I think it is?

1126
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:31,709
Holy shit!

1127
01:08:31,742 --> 01:08:35,144
I used to see this thing
on the news when I was a kid!

1128
01:08:35,178 --> 01:08:36,446
Okay, well...

1129
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,247
refine search.

1130
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:39,917
Date of birth.

1131
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:42,452
- Wasn't born. He arrived.
- Oh!

1132
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:44,622
Oh, Barry, look!

1133
01:08:44,655 --> 01:08:45,623
I'm busy.

1134
01:08:45,656 --> 01:08:47,658
With what?

1135
01:08:47,691 --> 01:08:50,259
Looking for unidentified objects
entering Earth's atmosphere

1136
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:52,630
anywhere near Kansas
in the last 50 years.

1137
01:08:52,663 --> 01:08:54,865
He has a back door into NASA.

1138
01:08:54,898 --> 01:08:55,899
'Course he does.

1139
01:08:57,701 --> 01:09:00,336
Yeah, but Barry, check this out.

1140
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:01,905
This bag laughs.

1141
01:09:03,574 --> 01:09:05,943
Okay, can't you
take anything seriously?

1142
01:09:05,976 --> 01:09:07,410
Stop messing around.

1143
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:08,946
Dude, come on.

1144
01:09:08,979 --> 01:09:10,881
Have you seen this place?

1145
01:09:10,914 --> 01:09:12,616
It's amazing!

1146
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:14,350
Hello!

1147
01:09:14,384 --> 01:09:17,186
Has the gravity of this
not sunk in for you?

1148
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:18,263
Stop messing around, Barry.

1149
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:19,556
I won't say it again.

1150
01:09:20,456 --> 01:09:22,526
Yeesh. Sorry, Mom.

1151
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,862
Shut up. Shut up.

1152
01:09:24,895 --> 01:09:26,496
You have no idea
how lucky you are.

1153
01:09:26,897 --> 01:09:28,899
No idea!

1154
01:09:28,932 --> 01:09:31,535
You take everything for granted.
You don't even appreciate...

1155
01:09:31,568 --> 01:09:34,237
You just walk around
thinking that you're so funny

1156
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:35,539
and so cool.

1157
01:09:35,572 --> 01:09:36,874
And it's embarrassing,

1158
01:09:36,907 --> 01:09:39,977
because you're not
any of those things!

1159
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:42,445
Hey, screw you, man!

1160
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:44,715
I've done nothing
but everything you've asked.

1161
01:09:44,748 --> 01:09:46,817
You made me
get struck by lightning!

1162
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:49,520
I phased naked through the floor.
And I terrified Mrs. Johannson.

1163
01:09:49,553 --> 01:09:51,287
Now I'm probably
gonna have to move.

1164
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,691
You won't even tell me
why you're here.

1165
01:09:53,724 --> 01:09:56,527
But will you at least tell me
why you're being so mean to me...

1166
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:57,695
for no reason?

1167
01:09:57,728 --> 01:10:00,229
You used Monkey as a dartboard!

1168
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:02,432
Wait, what?

1169
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:04,332
Forget it.

1170
01:10:06,537 --> 01:10:08,539
The monkey? Wait...

1171
01:10:08,572 --> 01:10:11,608
So, you're mad at me
for playing with a toy?

1172
01:10:11,642 --> 01:10:13,677
It's not a toy.

1173
01:10:13,711 --> 01:10:15,378
Mom bought us that monkey.

1174
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:17,380
'Cause she calls us Monkey.

1175
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:20,249
She gives us monkey stuff
all the time.

1176
01:10:21,018 --> 01:10:22,018
Right.

1177
01:10:22,986 --> 01:10:23,986
Look...

1178
01:10:24,755 --> 01:10:25,956
I'm sorry.

1179
01:10:28,025 --> 01:10:30,426
I'm not very good with people.

1180
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:31,662
Even myself.

1181
01:10:31,695 --> 01:10:32,695
Oh.

1182
01:10:33,463 --> 01:10:34,497
Come on, dude.

1183
01:10:34,531 --> 01:10:36,265
You're... You're not that bad.

1184
01:10:36,299 --> 01:10:37,899
You can just be kind of a dick
sometimes.

1185
01:10:40,537 --> 01:10:42,940
But let's face it.
I am pretty obnoxious.

1186
01:10:42,973 --> 01:10:44,908
But I just get excited.

1187
01:10:44,942 --> 01:10:47,611
Come on. This place
is pretty cool, right?

1188
01:10:48,545 --> 01:10:49,545
Yeah.

1189
01:10:51,949 --> 01:10:53,517
All right, well, um...

1190
01:10:55,485 --> 01:10:56,587
I'll let you work.

1191
01:11:16,607 --> 01:11:17,727
I know you're there.

1192
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:22,713
<i>You know what I'm stuck on?</i>

1193
01:11:22,746 --> 01:11:25,381
<i>That thing you said,
with the spaghetti.</i>

1194
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:28,351
<i>You said there were certain intersections
that would always be inevitable.</i>

1195
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,420
You had an Alfred.

1196
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:33,557
<i>My Bruce has an Alfred.</i>

1197
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:35,692
<i>Different worlds,
different times...</i>

1198
01:11:35,726 --> 01:11:37,895
<i>yet there it is.</i>

1199
01:11:37,928 --> 01:11:40,063
<i>Certain people,</i>

1200
01:11:40,097 --> 01:11:43,834
<i>certain events,
certain strands of spaghetti,</i>

1201
01:11:43,867 --> 01:11:46,469
<i>drawn to each other
like... like magnets.</i>

1202
01:11:47,538 --> 01:11:48,939
<i>I've read all about</i>

1203
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:51,975
<i>temporal paradoxes
and causal loops.</i>

1204
01:11:53,143 --> 01:11:55,378
But this is more than that.

1205
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:57,648
<i>Inevitable intersections</i>

1206
01:11:57,681 --> 01:11:59,424
<i>are something none of the theories
could have anticipated 'cause,</i>

1207
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:01,919
<i>well, how do you explain that
except for...</i>

1208
01:12:03,587 --> 01:12:05,122
<i>fate?</i>

1209
01:12:05,155 --> 01:12:07,124
<i>If you are listening,</i>

1210
01:12:07,157 --> 01:12:09,425
<i>sorry about your parents.</i>

1211
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:10,794
<i>I'm just trying to save mine.</i>

1212
01:12:12,896 --> 01:12:14,798
<i>There has to be a way.</i>

1213
01:12:14,832 --> 01:12:16,567
<i>There is a way, Barry.</i>

1214
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,801
<i>Just keep trying.</i>

1215
01:12:17,835 --> 01:12:18,969
<i>Keep trying, Barry.</i>

1216
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,615
Found him.

1217
01:13:04,648 --> 01:13:06,650
Barry, wake up.

1218
01:13:06,683 --> 01:13:10,486
Clark's being held by a mercenary
group in a Siberian black site.

1219
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:11,521
Get up, Barry.

1220
01:13:11,555 --> 01:13:13,489
The goat's on fire.

1221
01:13:13,523 --> 01:13:14,925
We're going to Russia.

1222
01:13:16,193 --> 01:13:17,895
Sweet.

1223
01:13:18,896 --> 01:13:22,132
Mm. Coffee.

1224
01:13:22,165 --> 01:13:23,567
How are we gonna get to Russia?

1225
01:14:01,038 --> 01:14:03,472
I'll help you get this Superman.

1226
01:14:03,507 --> 01:14:05,876
Then, you're on your own.

1227
01:14:08,145 --> 01:14:09,846
Oh!

1228
01:14:11,148 --> 01:14:12,149
You're...

1229
01:14:13,083 --> 01:14:14,483
You are, you're...

1230
01:14:18,789 --> 01:14:19,790
Yeah.

1231
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:22,726
I'm Batman.

1232
01:15:10,574 --> 01:15:12,542
So, what's the plan?
We're just gonna, what,

1233
01:15:12,576 --> 01:15:15,145
grab Superman and dip set
before the block is hot?

1234
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:16,580
I don't know.

1235
01:15:16,613 --> 01:15:17,757
Hey, you should ask him.

1236
01:15:19,249 --> 01:15:20,727
- You ask him.
- You should ask him.

1237
01:15:20,751 --> 01:15:22,319
Yeah, I'm not gonna ask him.

1238
01:15:22,352 --> 01:15:23,997
Why not? I thought Batman
was supposed to be your friend.

1239
01:15:24,021 --> 01:15:26,156
Not this one. Not this Batman.

1240
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:28,989
- We're here.
<i>- Activating hover mode.</i>

1241
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:35,632
<i>- Ejector seat on.</i>
- Ejector seat.

1242
01:15:35,665 --> 01:15:38,001
Ejector seat.

1243
01:15:41,671 --> 01:15:43,140
Okay, there are stages.

1244
01:15:44,775 --> 01:15:46,276
You're strapped
to your parachutes.

1245
01:15:49,146 --> 01:15:50,180
Hey, where's yours?

1246
01:16:01,058 --> 01:16:03,060
Whoo! This rips dicks!

1247
01:16:22,913 --> 01:16:24,714
All clear. Let's move.

1248
01:16:40,363 --> 01:16:41,998
Okay!

1249
01:16:50,373 --> 01:16:53,143
Good. Everybody's fast now
but me.

1250
01:16:53,176 --> 01:16:55,812
- Why is it so cold?
- It's the Arctic, Barry.

1251
01:16:58,315 --> 01:17:01,284
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know. Just follow the footprints.

1252
01:17:06,456 --> 01:17:08,625
Superman would be down there
for sure.

1253
01:17:50,734 --> 01:17:52,269
Yeah. Okay.

1254
01:18:20,063 --> 01:18:21,498
What did you do?

1255
01:18:21,532 --> 01:18:23,501
I had to move you.
But I just did it a little.

1256
01:18:32,442 --> 01:18:33,843
This might hurt.

1257
01:18:42,118 --> 01:18:43,718
Just let it out.

1258
01:19:20,457 --> 01:19:21,891
Let's go.

1259
01:19:29,466 --> 01:19:31,569
That's where you keep Superman.

1260
01:19:31,602 --> 01:19:32,836
Like a big scrotum.

1261
01:19:44,881 --> 01:19:48,051
He's gonna hack the Soviet security
cyberscrotum with a flip phone?

1262
01:19:53,256 --> 01:19:54,891
I tried all the combinations.

1263
01:19:57,894 --> 01:19:58,928
Yes!

1264
01:20:41,137 --> 01:20:42,138
Shit.

1265
01:20:43,273 --> 01:20:44,274
Kal-El?

1266
01:20:47,277 --> 01:20:49,379
It's not him.
We've gotta go.

1267
01:20:49,412 --> 01:20:51,214
Wait.

1268
01:20:51,247 --> 01:20:53,283
We can't just leave her here.
Look at her.

1269
01:20:54,618 --> 01:20:57,020
I'll grab her. Just go!

1270
01:21:04,294 --> 01:21:05,462
I got you.

1271
01:21:24,314 --> 01:21:25,315
I'll handle this jabroni.

1272
01:21:31,054 --> 01:21:33,156
What the...

1273
01:21:41,164 --> 01:21:42,600
Barry! Somebody shot me!

1274
01:21:47,505 --> 01:21:49,172
Time to dip set!

1275
01:21:58,348 --> 01:21:59,626
You, you lead the way!

1276
01:21:59,650 --> 01:22:02,452
- Go!
- Not that way! Not that way!

1277
01:22:13,731 --> 01:22:15,131
Oh, God!

1278
01:22:15,165 --> 01:22:16,700
Cover!

1279
01:22:24,407 --> 01:22:25,543
No!

1280
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:34,730
It's coming around.
Hurry, hurry.

1281
01:22:43,259 --> 01:22:45,962
No, no, no! This is bullshit!

1282
01:22:55,238 --> 01:22:56,774
No!

1283
01:22:56,807 --> 01:22:58,174
Come on.

1284
01:22:58,609 --> 01:23:00,009
Let's go.

1285
01:23:01,512 --> 01:23:03,112
You didn't tell me
we could get shot!

1286
01:23:03,146 --> 01:23:04,426
Why would you assume
we couldn't?

1287
01:23:16,092 --> 01:23:19,429
Oh, great! To die
at the feet of a Sputnik.

1288
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:26,402
Oh, man! I need this knee!

1289
01:23:26,436 --> 01:23:28,506
- Stay calm. It'll heal.
- Come on.

1290
01:23:41,484 --> 01:23:42,696
- How much do you weigh?
- 180.

1291
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,420
Each. Plus her, 440.

1292
01:23:51,327 --> 01:23:52,395
Hold on.

1293
01:24:21,759 --> 01:24:23,159
Oh, great.
They're here.

1294
01:24:23,192 --> 01:24:24,227
They're over here, too.

1295
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:25,495
Smirnoff Ice.

1296
01:24:25,529 --> 01:24:27,130
- Yes. Smirnoff Ice.
- Hi.

1297
01:24:27,163 --> 01:24:29,232
Stop them!

1298
01:24:29,265 --> 01:24:31,105
- Yep.
- Okay, they're serious. Barry, shut up.

1299
01:24:31,134 --> 01:24:32,235
Yeah, okay.

1300
01:24:32,268 --> 01:24:33,403
What's the play?

1301
01:24:33,436 --> 01:24:34,676
Batman, what do we do?
What now?

1302
01:24:39,309 --> 01:24:40,310
Now...

1303
01:24:41,244 --> 01:24:42,412
we try not to die.

1304
01:25:42,305 --> 01:25:44,808
Oh,
you guys should've seen that in slo-mo.

1305
01:26:21,779 --> 01:26:24,915
Yeah, I'm just realizing
that I didn't really think this through.

1306
01:26:24,948 --> 01:26:26,617
There are good Kryptonians...

1307
01:26:26,650 --> 01:26:28,952
and then there are very,
very bad Kryptonians.

1308
01:26:28,986 --> 01:26:30,587
And I was very confident

1309
01:26:30,621 --> 01:26:32,221
that we were just
gonna find Superman,

1310
01:26:32,255 --> 01:26:34,223
and if we found Superman,

1311
01:26:34,257 --> 01:26:35,859
then this would all be
super simple.

1312
01:26:35,893 --> 01:26:37,828
- Who are you?
- Holy Funyuns.

1313
01:26:39,663 --> 01:26:40,764
Hi.

1314
01:26:40,798 --> 01:26:42,966
- I... I'm Barry.
- We're Barry.

1315
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,703
We were trying to find Kal-El.

1316
01:26:45,736 --> 01:26:47,805
But we found you instead.

1317
01:26:47,838 --> 01:26:49,439
What do you want with Kal-El?

1318
01:26:49,472 --> 01:26:50,908
We were trying to rescue him.

1319
01:26:50,941 --> 01:26:52,776
Why?

1320
01:26:52,810 --> 01:26:55,646
Because he's my friend.

1321
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:56,980
Do you... Do you know him?

1322
01:26:57,014 --> 01:26:59,315
She looks mad. Get ready.

1323
01:26:59,348 --> 01:27:01,628
She might do laser vision,
or she might do, like, a freezy breath...

1324
01:27:01,652 --> 01:27:04,287
- or she'll just start throwing crazy...
- My name is Kara.

1325
01:27:05,321 --> 01:27:06,489
Daughter of Zor-El.

1326
01:27:07,423 --> 01:27:08,892
Kal-El was my cousin.

1327
01:27:08,926 --> 01:27:11,394
- Right, and who's Kal-El again?
- It's Superman.

1328
01:27:11,427 --> 01:27:13,964
- No, 'cause you said that was Clark.
- Who's Clark?

1329
01:27:13,997 --> 01:27:17,333
Clark is his human name.

1330
01:27:17,366 --> 01:27:18,468
Clark.

1331
01:27:21,538 --> 01:27:23,439
He was an infant when we left.

1332
01:27:24,742 --> 01:27:26,442
The last son of Krypton... I...

1333
01:27:28,444 --> 01:27:29,813
I was sent to protect him.

1334
01:27:29,847 --> 01:27:31,815
It looks like
he never made it to Earth

1335
01:27:31,849 --> 01:27:33,817
in this universe.

1336
01:27:33,851 --> 01:27:36,352
Our pods,
they must have separated.

1337
01:27:36,385 --> 01:27:37,921
Wait, so you thought a baby

1338
01:27:37,955 --> 01:27:40,524
was gonna protect us
from this Zod guy?

1339
01:27:40,557 --> 01:27:41,992
General Zod is here.

1340
01:27:42,025 --> 01:27:44,360
He must have tracked
my pod's signal.

1341
01:27:44,393 --> 01:27:46,630
- I have to go.
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

1342
01:27:46,663 --> 01:27:50,366
Well, you need to recover
your strength. Actually, Barry...

1343
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:51,802
take her to the roof

1344
01:27:51,835 --> 01:27:53,837
and put her in the sun.

1345
01:27:53,871 --> 01:27:55,304
Yeah.

1346
01:27:55,338 --> 01:27:57,306
- Yeah.
- Whatever, like if, I mean,

1347
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:58,776
you're solar powered.

1348
01:27:58,809 --> 01:28:00,443
Good for you.
I've been trying to...

1349
01:28:00,476 --> 01:28:01,812
Oh, uh...

1350
01:28:02,946 --> 01:28:05,381
We'll take that with us.

1351
01:28:14,357 --> 01:28:16,960
Um, am I cool to...

1352
01:28:16,994 --> 01:28:17,994
turn around?

1353
01:28:18,996 --> 01:28:20,463
Are you dressed

1354
01:28:20,496 --> 01:28:22,599
in a red cape?

1355
01:28:29,072 --> 01:28:31,374
You're levitating?

1356
01:28:38,749 --> 01:28:40,017
Is it always this loud?

1357
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:44,922
Is it loud?

1358
01:28:44,955 --> 01:28:48,391
Are you, uh, good?
Do you feel, um...

1359
01:28:48,424 --> 01:28:49,593
strong yet, or...

1360
01:28:55,566 --> 01:28:56,900
Yep, that seems, uh,

1361
01:28:56,934 --> 01:28:58,735
seems strong. You know...

1362
01:28:58,769 --> 01:29:01,470
old man Barry, down there,

1363
01:29:01,505 --> 01:29:03,707
says if we don't stop
Captain Zode,

1364
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:06,009
he'll kill thousands of people.

1365
01:29:06,043 --> 01:29:07,644
Billions of people.

1366
01:29:07,678 --> 01:29:08,745
Billions?

1367
01:29:10,446 --> 01:29:11,715
Of your people.

1368
01:29:11,748 --> 01:29:13,517
- They're good people.
- Good people?

1369
01:29:14,651 --> 01:29:16,385
We came to this planet

1370
01:29:16,419 --> 01:29:18,421
looking for
a safe place to live,

1371
01:29:18,454 --> 01:29:20,624
and they put me in a cage.

1372
01:29:20,657 --> 01:29:23,392
Yeah. A lot of humans
are dicks.

1373
01:29:23,426 --> 01:29:25,696
But then

1374
01:29:25,729 --> 01:29:27,998
there's babies and ballerinas.

1375
01:29:28,031 --> 01:29:29,867
And entertainment wrestlers.

1376
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:31,467
A lot of humans
are worth saving.

1377
01:29:32,569 --> 01:29:33,737
Maybe to you.

1378
01:29:35,038 --> 01:29:36,506
But I'm not a human.

1379
01:29:37,875 --> 01:29:39,109
I'm a Kryptonian.

1380
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,681
She's gone.

1381
01:29:44,715 --> 01:29:46,482
I have to get my powers back.

1382
01:29:49,119 --> 01:29:50,587
If I can re-create the accident

1383
01:29:50,621 --> 01:29:52,022
that gave me my powers...

1384
01:29:52,055 --> 01:29:53,633
maybe I can reconnect
to the Speed Force...

1385
01:29:53,657 --> 01:29:56,492
and maybe we'd stand a chance
against Zod.

1386
01:29:56,526 --> 01:29:58,862
Or kill yourself in the process.

1387
01:30:01,865 --> 01:30:02,865
Tell me something.

1388
01:30:04,668 --> 01:30:06,770
If you get your powers back,

1389
01:30:06,803 --> 01:30:08,038
you can go anywhere.

1390
01:30:08,071 --> 01:30:09,706
You can go to another timeline,

1391
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:11,074
another universe.

1392
01:30:11,108 --> 01:30:13,442
Why do you wanna stay...

1393
01:30:13,476 --> 01:30:15,712
and fight to save this one?

1394
01:30:15,746 --> 01:30:18,015
Because this is the world
where my mom lives.

1395
01:30:21,218 --> 01:30:23,987
I went back in time to save her.

1396
01:30:24,021 --> 01:30:26,123
I'm not gonna lose her again.

1397
01:30:26,156 --> 01:30:28,058
The kid doesn't know, does he?

1398
01:30:28,091 --> 01:30:30,861
How do you tell someone
something like that?

1399
01:30:34,497 --> 01:30:36,499
I lost my parents...

1400
01:30:39,269 --> 01:30:40,971
but that pain...

1401
01:30:44,708 --> 01:30:46,209
made me who I am.

1402
01:30:46,243 --> 01:30:48,812
I'm not sure I know who I am
without it, actually.

1403
01:30:53,050 --> 01:30:55,852
I spent a lifetime...

1404
01:30:55,886 --> 01:30:58,755
trying to right
the wrongs of the past.

1405
01:31:00,057 --> 01:31:01,258
As if

1406
01:31:01,291 --> 01:31:04,161
putting on a cape
and fighting crime

1407
01:31:04,194 --> 01:31:06,063
would bring my parents back.

1408
01:31:12,002 --> 01:31:13,469
You actually did it.

1409
01:31:14,705 --> 01:31:16,239
So...

1410
01:31:16,273 --> 01:31:17,774
I guess the plan is

1411
01:31:17,808 --> 01:31:20,077
to douse yourself
in industrial chemicals

1412
01:31:20,110 --> 01:31:21,979
while electrocuting yourself?

1413
01:31:22,012 --> 01:31:23,012
Yep.

1414
01:31:27,084 --> 01:31:28,285
Want some help?

1415
01:31:30,187 --> 01:31:32,689
Hell yeah. That
would be incredibly useful.

1416
01:31:32,723 --> 01:31:34,233
I've actually already
borrowed some chemicals

1417
01:31:34,257 --> 01:31:35,625
and your soldering iron,

1418
01:31:35,659 --> 01:31:37,794
and I'm sitting
in your bat-seat.

1419
01:31:37,828 --> 01:31:39,162
Is that like a faux pas?

1420
01:31:51,141 --> 01:31:54,611
<i>Wilco, Lima,
Zebra, be advised...</i>

1421
01:31:58,615 --> 01:32:00,584
<i>Air Command to Bravo 601.</i>

1422
01:32:00,617 --> 01:32:02,953
<i>Primary teams,
please confirm your AORs.</i>

1423
01:32:21,805 --> 01:32:24,445
- Green teams ready to move.
- Standing by!

1424
01:32:25,742 --> 01:32:29,646
<i>You bring me nothing? Hmm.</i>

1425
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:32,015
<i>I gave you a warning.</i>

1426
01:32:32,049 --> 01:32:34,785
<i>Your failure to deliver
the Kryptonian traitor</i>

1427
01:32:34,818 --> 01:32:36,953
<i>is being taken as an act of war.</i>

1428
01:32:40,624 --> 01:32:41,968
- Fire, fire, fire!
<i>- We have contact, contact!</i>

1429
01:32:41,992 --> 01:32:42,726
<i>Weapons hot!
Weapons hot! Open fire!</i>

1430
01:32:42,759 --> 01:32:45,062
No.

1431
01:32:45,095 --> 01:32:47,864
<i>Air support now!
I repeat, air support!</i>

1432
01:33:15,192 --> 01:33:17,360
Okay, when I throw the switch,

1433
01:33:17,394 --> 01:33:19,029
the current should
run up the wire

1434
01:33:19,062 --> 01:33:21,698
and draw the lightning
right to the kite.

1435
01:33:21,731 --> 01:33:22,999
Here, put that on.

1436
01:33:23,033 --> 01:33:24,401
It's heat and impact resistant.

1437
01:33:24,434 --> 01:33:26,169
Should protect you a little.

1438
01:33:26,203 --> 01:33:28,203
Right, but the point is
for me to not be protected.

1439
01:33:29,773 --> 01:33:30,773
Okay.

1440
01:33:33,376 --> 01:33:35,145
You're gonna need
to be out of the way.

1441
01:33:35,178 --> 01:33:36,179
I will.

1442
01:33:40,717 --> 01:33:41,718
Let's get electrocuted.

1443
01:33:47,691 --> 01:33:49,092
This is going to work, right?

1444
01:33:49,126 --> 01:33:50,927
Of course it's gonna work.

1445
01:33:50,961 --> 01:33:52,729
Nothing we haven't done before.

1446
01:33:52,762 --> 01:33:54,364
Besides, this time
we have Batman.

1447
01:33:54,397 --> 01:33:55,999
What could go wrong?

1448
01:33:56,032 --> 01:33:58,101
Uh, for the record,
I think this is insane.

1449
01:33:59,836 --> 01:34:00,836
Get back.

1450
01:34:06,776 --> 01:34:07,777
It's fine. It's fine.

1451
01:34:17,754 --> 01:34:19,823
Just you and me again,
Mr. Lightning.

1452
01:34:26,730 --> 01:34:27,730
Do it!

1453
01:34:50,086 --> 01:34:51,288
Wait, what? No!

1454
01:34:51,321 --> 01:34:53,223
No, wait! Stop! Stop!

1455
01:35:00,330 --> 01:35:02,032
Oh, God.

1456
01:35:02,065 --> 01:35:03,233
Oh, God.

1457
01:35:03,266 --> 01:35:04,266
Barry, no.

1458
01:35:07,971 --> 01:35:08,971
Go again.

1459
01:35:10,073 --> 01:35:11,308
But...

1460
01:35:11,341 --> 01:35:12,341
Please.

1461
01:35:20,551 --> 01:35:22,085
The circuit is fried.

1462
01:36:20,377 --> 01:36:21,378
I've got you.

1463
01:36:53,476 --> 01:36:55,478
Hey. Barry.

1464
01:36:57,047 --> 01:36:59,282
You're okay.
It's like last time, right?

1465
01:36:59,316 --> 01:37:00,483
So, you gotta heal now.

1466
01:37:18,536 --> 01:37:19,637
Look, look, look!

1467
01:37:19,670 --> 01:37:21,171
It's working. It's working.

1468
01:37:21,204 --> 01:37:23,173
Yeah, it's working. Yeah.

1469
01:37:23,206 --> 01:37:25,108
Yeah,
he's healing. He's healing.

1470
01:37:25,141 --> 01:37:26,976
Oh, my God. He's okay.

1471
01:37:27,010 --> 01:37:29,212
Dude, you scared
the shit out of me.

1472
01:38:13,022 --> 01:38:14,491
You're awake.

1473
01:38:14,525 --> 01:38:15,626
How you feeling?

1474
01:38:16,426 --> 01:38:17,426
Slow.

1475
01:38:18,261 --> 01:38:20,063
Maybe this will help.

1476
01:38:30,073 --> 01:38:32,075
Ooh... Ooh!

1477
01:38:32,543 --> 01:38:33,544
Yes!

1478
01:38:33,577 --> 01:38:36,179
Dude, come on! Irresistible!

1479
01:38:36,212 --> 01:38:37,947
Man, feels good to be back.

1480
01:38:37,981 --> 01:38:39,282
Yeah!

1481
01:38:39,315 --> 01:38:41,017
And what are we wearing tonight?

1482
01:38:41,050 --> 01:38:42,352
You like it?

1483
01:38:42,385 --> 01:38:44,220
I-I made it myself
out of that old Batsuit.

1484
01:38:44,254 --> 01:38:46,389
But you know,
I made it our colors and everything.

1485
01:38:46,423 --> 01:38:48,559
Well, check this out!

1486
01:38:48,592 --> 01:38:50,460
It's a bit more loose.

1487
01:38:52,996 --> 01:38:54,063
It beeves.

1488
01:38:55,198 --> 01:38:56,600
Dude...

1489
01:38:56,634 --> 01:38:58,134
you really mean that?

1490
01:38:58,168 --> 01:38:59,603
I mean, I don't...

1491
01:38:59,637 --> 01:39:03,173
I don't know what it means,
exactly, to beeve.

1492
01:39:03,206 --> 01:39:05,975
But it seems like it's positive.

1493
01:39:06,009 --> 01:39:07,009
What are you doing?

1494
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:11,181
You came back.

1495
01:39:11,214 --> 01:39:13,216
I'm glad you're okay.

1496
01:39:13,249 --> 01:39:16,019
I have to ask you something.

1497
01:39:16,052 --> 01:39:18,522
When you found me in that hole
that they put me in...

1498
01:39:20,023 --> 01:39:21,525
and I wasn't Kal-El...

1499
01:39:24,227 --> 01:39:26,095
why did you help me?

1500
01:39:26,129 --> 01:39:27,497
Because you needed help.

1501
01:39:30,333 --> 01:39:33,369
Do you know
what this symbol stands for?

1502
01:39:33,403 --> 01:39:35,506
- Supergirl?
- It means hope, right?

1503
01:39:35,539 --> 01:39:37,641
Hope, yeah. Does it mean hope?

1504
01:39:37,675 --> 01:39:40,376
Krypton was a beautiful place.

1505
01:39:42,479 --> 01:39:44,080
We are a people of hope,

1506
01:39:44,815 --> 01:39:46,416
not war.

1507
01:39:48,051 --> 01:39:49,587
<i>I'm coming to you live
from Metropolis,</i>

1508
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:51,263
<i>where minutes ago,
the mysterious flying...</i>

1509
01:39:51,287 --> 01:39:53,256
Zod may be from Krypton,

1510
01:39:53,289 --> 01:39:56,125
but he is not my people.

1511
01:39:56,159 --> 01:39:58,461
So, you're saying...

1512
01:39:58,495 --> 01:40:00,230
Yes.

1513
01:40:00,263 --> 01:40:01,699
I will help you fight Zod.

1514
01:40:04,602 --> 01:40:06,504
Yes!

1515
01:40:06,537 --> 01:40:08,404
Interesting group.

1516
01:40:08,438 --> 01:40:11,307
What did you say, uh...

1517
01:40:11,341 --> 01:40:12,543
we were called again?

1518
01:40:12,576 --> 01:40:14,578
We're the Justice League.

1519
01:40:14,612 --> 01:40:15,713
No.

1520
01:40:15,746 --> 01:40:18,716
- No?
- Well, I mean, kinda.

1521
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:20,751
We are short

1522
01:40:20,784 --> 01:40:22,285
one literal goddess...

1523
01:40:22,318 --> 01:40:23,787
one friendly Terminator

1524
01:40:23,821 --> 01:40:26,590
and super mermaid.

1525
01:40:26,624 --> 01:40:28,726
And we could
definitely use a Batman.

1526
01:40:31,795 --> 01:40:33,196
Are you in?

1527
01:40:38,368 --> 01:40:39,469
You wanna get nuts?

1528
01:40:42,105 --> 01:40:43,439
Let's get nuts.

1529
01:40:56,720 --> 01:40:59,489
In my world, Superman showed up
right away when Zod called him out.

1530
01:40:59,523 --> 01:41:02,091
So, as of now,
we're in uncharted territory.

1531
01:41:02,125 --> 01:41:05,261
What I do know is that Zod
somehow controls the World Engines,

1532
01:41:05,295 --> 01:41:06,797
which will be destroying
much more

1533
01:41:06,830 --> 01:41:08,464
than just Metropolis now

1534
01:41:08,498 --> 01:41:10,309
with every passing second
that we don't stop him.

1535
01:41:10,333 --> 01:41:11,401
Barry, what are you doing?

1536
01:41:11,434 --> 01:41:12,434
What?

1537
01:41:13,804 --> 01:41:15,305
Our kids are gonna
wanna see this.

1538
01:41:15,338 --> 01:41:16,338
Your kids?

1539
01:41:18,542 --> 01:41:21,512
Well, you know, like everybody's
kids. I mean, the children of the world.

1540
01:41:21,545 --> 01:41:22,713
They're gonna wanna see this.

1541
01:41:25,348 --> 01:41:27,116
We're getting close.

1542
01:41:27,150 --> 01:41:29,161
I'm gonna stay airborne
and take out their sky power.

1543
01:41:29,185 --> 01:41:30,554
And Barry, just so we're clear

1544
01:41:30,588 --> 01:41:31,765
what that essentially equates
to is you and me

1545
01:41:31,789 --> 01:41:33,724
versus the entire
Kryptonian army.

1546
01:41:33,757 --> 01:41:35,358
Chill.

1547
01:41:35,391 --> 01:41:37,828
We need to buy Kara enough time
to take out Zod.

1548
01:41:37,861 --> 01:41:40,272
Oh, and remember that your suit
doesn't dissipate energy like mine

1549
01:41:40,296 --> 01:41:41,699
so you need to take breaks,

1550
01:41:41,732 --> 01:41:43,510
otherwise you're gonna build up
too much charge.

1551
01:41:43,534 --> 01:41:45,134
Wait, what?

1552
01:42:02,251 --> 01:42:03,654
Dang it!

1553
01:42:05,488 --> 01:42:07,156
Hold on!

1554
01:42:08,892 --> 01:42:10,412
- Okay!
- Hold on.

1555
01:42:12,529 --> 01:42:13,831
The humans we came to protect?

1556
01:42:13,864 --> 01:42:15,532
They don't know
we're on their side.

1557
01:42:50,868 --> 01:42:51,868
Zod.

1558
01:43:01,277 --> 01:43:02,445
Kara Zor-El.

1559
01:43:02,478 --> 01:43:03,914
We've been waiting for you.

1560
01:43:06,884 --> 01:43:08,384
Go, go!

1561
01:43:09,553 --> 01:43:10,554
Cover!

1562
01:43:14,558 --> 01:43:16,627
- Drag him out, drag him!
- You go! I'll cover!

1563
01:43:33,811 --> 01:43:36,446
Okay, and the space giant...

1564
01:43:36,479 --> 01:43:38,281
and Mistress Murder...

1565
01:43:38,314 --> 01:43:40,383
- are our responsibility, too?
- Hey, hey, hey.

1566
01:43:40,416 --> 01:43:41,928
Don't think about them, okay?
Calm down.

1567
01:43:41,952 --> 01:43:44,021
We're just gonna start
with those guys over there.

1568
01:43:44,054 --> 01:43:45,732
And yeah, they're Kryptonian,
and we won't be able to kill them,

1569
01:43:45,756 --> 01:43:47,658
but we can slow them down
for her.

1570
01:43:47,691 --> 01:43:50,326
One at a time.

1571
01:43:50,359 --> 01:43:52,863
Okay? I'm gonna disarm them,
and then you'll engage.

1572
01:43:54,998 --> 01:43:55,999
Punch 'em.

1573
01:43:57,634 --> 01:43:59,435
Come on, Barbie.

1574
01:43:59,469 --> 01:44:01,437
Let's go party?

1575
01:44:08,311 --> 01:44:09,646
Okay, ow!

1576
01:44:11,915 --> 01:44:12,916
Oh.

1577
01:44:17,921 --> 01:44:18,889
Okay. It's okay.

1578
01:44:18,922 --> 01:44:20,591
You're okay. Come on.

1579
01:44:20,624 --> 01:44:21,925
Jesus, they're fast.

1580
01:44:21,959 --> 01:44:23,761
Yes, but not as fast as us.

1581
01:44:27,564 --> 01:44:29,600
Terraforming has begun.

1582
01:44:29,633 --> 01:44:31,400
This world must die

1583
01:44:31,434 --> 01:44:33,469
so that ours may live again.

1584
01:44:41,111 --> 01:44:42,980
Oh, my God. We gotta go.
We gotta go.

1585
01:44:43,013 --> 01:44:44,581
Dan, Danny, go, go!

1586
01:44:45,916 --> 01:44:48,317
Krypton is gone, Zod.

1587
01:44:48,351 --> 01:44:49,720
Your uncle...

1588
01:44:49,753 --> 01:44:50,754
Jor-El...

1589
01:44:52,122 --> 01:44:53,489
hid the key

1590
01:44:53,524 --> 01:44:56,325
to Krypton's rebirth

1591
01:44:56,359 --> 01:44:58,695
inside a Kryptonian child.

1592
01:44:58,729 --> 01:45:00,998
All the genetic material needed

1593
01:45:01,031 --> 01:45:02,866
to start again

1594
01:45:02,900 --> 01:45:04,802
coded inside the DNA,

1595
01:45:04,835 --> 01:45:07,538
then sent to Earth
in an escape pod.

1596
01:45:07,571 --> 01:45:09,472
He's not here. You have failed.

1597
01:45:10,707 --> 01:45:11,708
We found him.

1598
01:45:13,777 --> 01:45:15,646
We intercepted his pod.

1599
01:45:17,915 --> 01:45:20,517
But your cousin was
not the one we needed.

1600
01:45:22,385 --> 01:45:24,387
You are the one.

1601
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:25,956
Kara Zor-El.

1602
01:45:25,989 --> 01:45:27,991
It is your blood...

1603
01:45:28,025 --> 01:45:29,126
we must harvest.

1604
01:45:29,159 --> 01:45:30,594
What did you do to Kal-El?

1605
01:45:30,627 --> 01:45:33,396
Your sacrifice that will allow

1606
01:45:33,429 --> 01:45:35,431
Krypton to live again.

1607
01:45:35,464 --> 01:45:38,334
What did you do?

1608
01:45:40,604 --> 01:45:43,339
The infant did not survive.

1609
01:46:16,773 --> 01:46:18,041
Look, new plan.

1610
01:46:18,075 --> 01:46:19,743
I'm gonna create
a cyclonic diversion.

1611
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:21,578
And you're gonna
just come in, hard.

1612
01:46:21,612 --> 01:46:22,646
Feet first this time.

1613
01:46:38,494 --> 01:46:39,963
Yes!

1614
01:46:39,997 --> 01:46:41,598
Barry, did you see that?

1615
01:46:41,632 --> 01:46:43,512
Be careful. You're accumulating
too much charge.

1616
01:46:45,002 --> 01:46:46,904
What if I just Emperor this guy?

1617
01:46:48,205 --> 01:46:50,406
No, no, no!

1618
01:47:17,167 --> 01:47:19,903
Barry, that was actually
only half stupid!

1619
01:47:19,937 --> 01:47:21,939
But if you're gonna do that
and not die,

1620
01:47:21,972 --> 01:47:23,874
you need to complete
the circuit somehow.

1621
01:47:23,907 --> 01:47:26,009
Try putting
your hands together, like this.

1622
01:47:28,912 --> 01:47:29,912
Oh, shit.

1623
01:47:31,848 --> 01:47:34,551
- You're ready.
- Let's go!

1624
01:47:45,729 --> 01:47:48,632
<i>♪ I seem to think I think
I got a little situation ♪</i>

1625
01:47:48,665 --> 01:47:51,568
<i>♪ So listen to me, sister
Listen maybe you can help ♪</i>

1626
01:47:51,601 --> 01:47:54,638
<i>♪ I think I gave a lot of

1627
01:47:54,671 --> 01:47:57,274
<i>♪ But not for me It always

1628
01:47:57,307 --> 01:48:00,577
<i>♪ Why all the people always

1629
01:48:00,610 --> 01:48:03,046

1630
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:05,983

01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:18,895
<i>♪ And only one I'm taking ♪</i>

1633
01:48:51,161 --> 01:48:52,763
I'm going after the big one.

1634
01:49:04,107 --> 01:49:05,107
I've been hit.

1635
01:49:07,844 --> 01:49:09,780
Bruce, do you copy?

1636
01:49:09,813 --> 01:49:11,314
- Where's Kara?
- You go find her.

1637
01:49:16,319 --> 01:49:17,319
Bruce!

1638
01:49:18,688 --> 01:49:20,724
<i>Ejection mode failure.</i>

1639
01:49:20,757 --> 01:49:22,659
<i>Ejection mode failure.</i>

1640
01:50:02,165 --> 01:50:03,867
Rest, Kara Zor-El.

1641
01:50:09,372 --> 01:50:10,774
Going down.

1642
01:50:15,812 --> 01:50:17,347
But I'm not going alone.

1643
01:50:17,380 --> 01:50:19,683
No, no, no, Bruce!

1644
01:50:19,716 --> 01:50:22,652
<i>Bruce, eject! Bruce,
just eject...</i>

1645
01:50:29,893 --> 01:50:30,894
No!

1646
01:50:42,772 --> 01:50:43,772
Kara.

1647
01:50:50,247 --> 01:50:52,082
Isn't supposed...

1648
01:50:54,151 --> 01:50:55,318
Not supposed to happen...

1649
01:51:01,892 --> 01:51:03,326
Kara's dead.

1650
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:04,895
They're both dead.

1651
01:51:04,928 --> 01:51:06,897
But they don't have to be,
right?

1652
01:51:06,930 --> 01:51:09,266
'Cause we can go back.

1653
01:51:09,299 --> 01:51:11,434
- Like you did.
- You're not fast enough yet.

1654
01:51:11,468 --> 01:51:12,468
You sure?

1655
01:51:14,505 --> 01:51:16,373
Barry!

1656
01:51:17,841 --> 01:51:18,875
Barry, wait!

1657
01:51:32,789 --> 01:51:34,357
Is this back enough?

1658
01:51:34,391 --> 01:51:35,759
Yeah, I guess so.

1659
01:51:42,265 --> 01:51:43,900
Listen, Barry, I...

1660
01:51:45,268 --> 01:51:49,039
What? It's okay.
We can fix this.

1661
01:51:49,072 --> 01:51:50,283
You know what
you're gonna change?

1662
01:51:50,307 --> 01:51:51,841
I know what I'm gonna change.

1663
01:51:56,780 --> 01:51:58,181
I'm going after the big one.

1664
01:52:00,784 --> 01:52:03,086
Bruce, pull off. That gunship
is shield-protected.

1665
01:52:03,119 --> 01:52:04,119
Roger that.

1666
01:52:07,824 --> 01:52:08,892
Bet he's not.

1667
01:52:10,060 --> 01:52:11,895
Who? Space giant?

1668
01:52:11,928 --> 01:52:13,430
Yes, yes, please take him out.

1669
01:52:55,005 --> 01:52:56,005
Yes.

1670
01:54:55,593 --> 01:54:56,627
No.

1671
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:58,360
Hey.

1672
01:54:59,295 --> 01:55:00,964
It'll be okay.

1673
01:55:00,997 --> 01:55:02,165
Not this time, kid.

1674
01:55:04,602 --> 01:55:06,436
Maybe some other time.

1675
01:55:12,475 --> 01:55:14,110
We can't bring you back, can we?

1676
01:55:15,646 --> 01:55:17,013
You already did.

1677
01:55:19,149 --> 01:55:20,483
You already did.

1678
01:55:31,127 --> 01:55:32,247
Come on, Barry.

1679
01:55:33,564 --> 01:55:35,198
Gotta get up. Come on.

1680
01:55:35,231 --> 01:55:36,433
- Barry.
- We go again.

1681
01:55:39,202 --> 01:55:40,970
Barry.

1682
01:55:42,606 --> 01:55:44,374
Let's just go.

1683
01:55:44,407 --> 01:55:46,109
Barry, come on. Let's just go.

1684
01:55:46,142 --> 01:55:47,511
Barry, there's no point.

1685
01:55:50,213 --> 01:55:51,515
Barry!

1686
01:56:11,635 --> 01:56:15,205
Phase!

1687
01:56:17,741 --> 01:56:20,376
Okay, I have to pull it out.

1688
01:56:20,410 --> 01:56:21,755
- I have to pull it out.
- No, I'm okay.

1689
01:56:21,779 --> 01:56:23,222
You have to phase again.
Barry, phase again.

1690
01:56:23,246 --> 01:56:24,290
I'm okay. I just
should've stopped sooner.

1691
01:56:24,314 --> 01:56:25,315
Ow!

1692
01:56:41,632 --> 01:56:42,999
Again.

1693
01:56:44,467 --> 01:56:45,467
Barry.

1694
01:56:54,143 --> 01:56:56,379
Okay, can we please
just take a minute?

1695
01:56:56,412 --> 01:56:59,082
Sorry, dude.
Yeah, bro, of course.

1696
01:56:59,115 --> 01:57:00,651
That's the whole thing.

1697
01:57:00,684 --> 01:57:02,653
We can take as much time
as it takes.

1698
01:57:02,686 --> 01:57:04,788
No, that's not what I mean.
Hey!

1699
01:57:26,309 --> 01:57:28,679
Okay, you good? Come on.

1700
01:57:28,712 --> 01:57:30,548
I need you in there. Let's go.

1701
01:57:30,581 --> 01:57:32,382
Barry, please,
just listen to me!

1702
01:57:50,466 --> 01:57:51,769
Where were you?

1703
01:57:51,802 --> 01:57:53,436
What, you just stand here
the whole time?

1704
01:57:53,469 --> 01:57:56,372
Barry, this is
an inevitable intersection.

1705
01:57:56,406 --> 01:57:58,241
You have to stop. Barry!

1706
01:58:13,524 --> 01:58:14,725
No, Barry, wait!

1707
01:58:20,764 --> 01:58:23,232
Barry, listen.

1708
01:58:23,266 --> 01:58:24,666
There's something
I should tell you.

1709
01:58:27,270 --> 01:58:29,640
I went back in time initially

1710
01:58:29,673 --> 01:58:32,275
- because...
- Yeah, because Mom died.

1711
01:58:32,308 --> 01:58:33,877
How do you know?

1712
01:58:33,911 --> 01:58:36,547
It doesn't matter. Does it?

1713
01:58:36,580 --> 01:58:38,281
You know that I have to
undo what I did.

1714
01:58:39,349 --> 01:58:40,249
No.

1715
01:58:40,283 --> 01:58:41,585
It's not a mistake.

1716
01:58:41,619 --> 01:58:42,653
We can save her.

1717
01:58:42,686 --> 01:58:43,887
And we can save them.

1718
01:58:43,921 --> 01:58:45,656
No, we can't.

1719
01:58:45,689 --> 01:58:48,458
This is what
Bruce was talking about.

1720
01:58:48,491 --> 01:58:50,628
Barry, this is inevitable.

1721
01:58:50,661 --> 01:58:53,341
We can try a million times,
and we're not gonna be able to fix this.

1722
01:58:53,931 --> 01:58:55,465
No matter what we do...

1723
01:58:56,199 --> 01:58:57,901
this world dies.

1724
01:58:58,869 --> 01:59:00,838
Today.

1725
01:59:00,871 --> 01:59:01,872
Look around.

1726
01:59:06,209 --> 01:59:08,244
Look at the damage
we're causing.

1727
01:59:14,350 --> 01:59:15,552
Now we have to stop.

1728
01:59:15,586 --> 01:59:16,854
Okay?

1729
01:59:16,887 --> 01:59:18,722
Look, I was just
doing my laundry.

1730
01:59:18,756 --> 01:59:21,859
You're the one who came and
told me that I'm a superhero.

1731
01:59:21,892 --> 01:59:23,761
And now you're saying what?

1732
01:59:23,794 --> 01:59:25,696
You don't want me to be?

1733
01:59:25,729 --> 01:59:28,331
Well, guess what!
It's too late!

1734
01:59:28,364 --> 01:59:30,868
I am...

1735
01:59:30,901 --> 01:59:32,468
The Flash.

1736
01:59:32,503 --> 01:59:34,404
And I can save everyone.

1737
01:59:34,437 --> 01:59:36,239
Nobody dies!

1738
01:59:36,272 --> 01:59:37,273
Barry...

1739
01:59:38,976 --> 01:59:40,811
not every problem
has a solution.

1740
01:59:49,887 --> 01:59:51,789
Not every problem
has a solution.

1741
01:59:55,926 --> 01:59:57,460
Sometimes we just
have to let go.

1742
01:59:57,493 --> 01:59:59,730
<i>Sometimes you just
have to let go.</i>

1743
01:59:59,763 --> 02:00:02,465
Let go of Mom?

1744
02:00:02,498 --> 02:00:05,736
She'll always be alive,
somewhere in time.

1745
02:00:06,904 --> 02:00:07,905
Always.

1746
02:00:08,672 --> 02:00:09,773
Just not for us.

1747
02:00:10,941 --> 02:00:13,242
You're full of shit, dude.

1748
02:00:13,276 --> 02:00:14,578
I'm going back.

1749
02:00:14,611 --> 02:00:16,479
You're going back to kill Mom?

1750
02:00:16,513 --> 02:00:17,648
No!

1751
02:00:17,681 --> 02:00:19,482
You're staying!

1752
02:00:19,516 --> 02:00:21,518
You stay, right here.

1753
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:24,521
Just give me one more time.

1754
02:00:24,555 --> 02:00:26,355
Barry, stop!

1755
02:00:26,389 --> 02:00:28,759
You, stop!

1756
02:01:00,090 --> 02:01:02,325
Feel like we got off
on the wrong foot.

1757
02:01:02,358 --> 02:01:04,928
Let's start again.
I'm the Flash.

1758
02:01:04,962 --> 02:01:05,996
What's your name?

1759
02:01:06,029 --> 02:01:08,665
I've lived...

1760
02:01:08,699 --> 02:01:10,634
more than you can dream.

1761
02:01:10,667 --> 02:01:13,336
Not an answer.

1762
02:01:13,369 --> 02:01:15,038
Do you, like, rehearse that?

1763
02:01:20,544 --> 02:01:21,945
Whoa.

1764
02:01:21,979 --> 02:01:23,446
Get out of here, Barry!

1765
02:01:38,095 --> 02:01:39,830
That scar, you...

1766
02:01:40,964 --> 02:01:41,964
Oh, my God.

1767
02:01:42,833 --> 02:01:45,468
So, you're... You are...

1768
02:01:45,502 --> 02:01:47,004
Yes, I am...

1769
02:01:47,638 --> 02:01:48,639
you.

1770
02:01:51,608 --> 02:01:53,577
We are so close.

1771
02:01:53,610 --> 02:01:55,579
I've got it almost figured out.

1772
02:01:55,612 --> 02:01:58,582
How long
have you been doing this?

1773
02:01:58,615 --> 02:02:01,051
Time is inconsequential.

1774
02:02:01,084 --> 02:02:02,084
Come on, Barry.

1775
02:02:11,728 --> 02:02:14,430
<i>Up in the sky!
It's a bird!</i>

1776
02:02:14,463 --> 02:02:15,766
<i>It's a plane!</i>

1777
02:02:15,799 --> 02:02:17,366
<i>It's Superman!</i>

1778
02:02:59,576 --> 02:03:01,178
<i>Purrfectly foolproof.</i>

1779
02:03:03,113 --> 02:03:04,557
<i>Only the
Joker would think of that.</i>

1780
02:03:42,920 --> 02:03:45,055
Please just look at
what's happening.

1781
02:03:46,556 --> 02:03:47,557
These worlds...

1782
02:03:56,633 --> 02:03:58,735
They're colliding
and collapsing.

1783
02:04:01,038 --> 02:04:02,139
We did this.

1784
02:04:04,141 --> 02:04:06,576
W-We're destroying
the fabric of everything.

1785
02:04:08,879 --> 02:04:10,047
You have to stop.

1786
02:04:10,080 --> 02:04:12,950
It stops once I've fixed it!

1787
02:04:14,685 --> 02:04:17,721
It's not entirely your fault,
Barry.

1788
02:04:17,754 --> 02:04:21,258
I pushed you out of the
Chronobowl on that September 29

1789
02:04:21,291 --> 02:04:24,628
so you could start me
on this path. Hmm?

1790
02:04:24,661 --> 02:04:27,164
How do you like
our endless paradox?

1791
02:04:27,197 --> 02:04:29,533
I made you create me...

1792
02:04:30,567 --> 02:04:32,235
and now you're the one...

1793
02:04:33,103 --> 02:04:35,005
in my way.

1794
02:04:35,038 --> 02:04:38,008
No matter how close I get
to winning this fight...

1795
02:04:38,041 --> 02:04:40,043
you go back

1796
02:04:40,077 --> 02:04:41,878
and let Mom die.

1797
02:04:41,912 --> 02:04:44,047
You're the inevitable
intersection.

1798
02:04:45,048 --> 02:04:47,284
And you do have to let go.

1799
02:04:47,317 --> 02:04:49,485
What's he talking about?

1800
02:04:50,587 --> 02:04:51,888
You're my hero.

1801
02:05:05,102 --> 02:05:07,571
What did you do?

1802
02:05:07,604 --> 02:05:10,173
Hey, hey. Don't worry.
It's gonna heal.

1803
02:05:10,207 --> 02:05:11,241
It's gonna heal.

1804
02:05:11,274 --> 02:05:12,976
I just wanted to...

1805
02:05:30,794 --> 02:05:32,229
You tell Mom I love her.

1806
02:06:43,934 --> 02:06:45,268
Don't forget the tomatoes.

1807
02:06:58,315 --> 02:07:00,917
I used to love that cereal
when I was a kid.

1808
02:07:01,384 --> 02:07:02,953
Yeah.

1809
02:07:02,986 --> 02:07:04,688
My son goes nuts for it.

1810
02:07:09,059 --> 02:07:11,094
They stop making it.

1811
02:07:11,128 --> 02:07:13,864
Well, I know they
were talking about discontinuing it.

1812
02:07:13,897 --> 02:07:16,333
- Do I know you?
- No, I'm not from around here.

1813
02:07:16,366 --> 02:07:18,401
I was just visiting my mom.

1814
02:07:18,435 --> 02:07:19,903
Maybe I know her.

1815
02:07:19,936 --> 02:07:21,104
What's her name?

1816
02:07:22,038 --> 02:07:24,141
She's the best...

1817
02:07:24,174 --> 02:07:26,143
and kindest person in the world.

1818
02:07:26,877 --> 02:07:27,777
You okay?

1819
02:07:27,811 --> 02:07:29,779
Yeah, I'm just...

1820
02:07:29,813 --> 02:07:30,853
I'm really gonna miss her.

1821
02:07:52,202 --> 02:07:53,870
I know I'm just...

1822
02:07:53,904 --> 02:07:55,972
a random lady in a store.

1823
02:07:56,006 --> 02:07:57,107
But do you want a hug?

1824
02:07:58,074 --> 02:07:59,075
Mm-hmm. Sure.

1825
02:08:05,182 --> 02:08:07,817
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, don't say that.

1826
02:08:09,753 --> 02:08:12,856
Your mom must be grateful
you came to visit her.

1827
02:08:12,889 --> 02:08:14,758
She's very lucky to have you.

1828
02:08:22,365 --> 02:08:24,367
I'm very lucky to have her.

1829
02:08:24,401 --> 02:08:28,038
Ah! You have to tell her that.

1830
02:08:28,071 --> 02:08:29,873
Moms like to hear
these kind of things.

1831
02:08:31,007 --> 02:08:32,008
Believe me.

1832
02:09:11,181 --> 02:09:12,382
Love you, Mom.

1833
02:09:20,257 --> 02:09:21,424
I love you more.

1834
02:09:23,527 --> 02:09:25,228
I loved you first.

1835
02:09:30,467 --> 02:09:31,569
Bye.

1836
02:09:31,602 --> 02:09:32,869
Bye.

1837
02:10:06,002 --> 02:10:07,170
I'm back.

1838
02:10:17,548 --> 02:10:18,549
Shit!

1839
02:10:19,316 --> 02:10:21,051
Court!

1840
02:10:30,093 --> 02:10:32,228
Original trial was initially...

1841
02:10:35,398 --> 02:10:36,466
I'm so sorry.

1842
02:10:40,937 --> 02:10:43,373
As I was saying...

1843
02:10:43,406 --> 02:10:45,875
the same
security camera footage,

1844
02:10:45,909 --> 02:10:47,877
Exhibit F in the original trial,

1845
02:10:47,911 --> 02:10:49,547
was initially
considered useless,

1846
02:10:49,580 --> 02:10:51,381
but has now

1847
02:10:51,414 --> 02:10:53,216
been enhanced,

1848
02:10:53,249 --> 02:10:55,418
using the latest tech

1849
02:10:55,452 --> 02:10:56,920
from Wayne Enterprises.

1850
02:10:57,987 --> 02:10:58,987
It confirms

1851
02:10:59,356 --> 02:11:00,890
the alibi

1852
02:11:00,924 --> 02:11:03,026
Mr. Allen has argued,

1853
02:11:03,059 --> 02:11:04,394
and his son, Barry,

1854
02:11:05,529 --> 02:11:08,398
has corroborated, since day one.

1855
02:11:14,337 --> 02:11:15,338
Here.

1856
02:11:19,008 --> 02:11:22,580
Right here, you can clearly see
my client, Mr. Allen,

1857
02:11:22,613 --> 02:11:25,683
reaching for a can of tomatoes

1858
02:11:25,716 --> 02:11:27,518
on the top shelf.

1859
02:11:45,536 --> 02:11:47,547
Mr. Allen, Mr. Allen, can you tell us a
bit more about what happened, please?

1860
02:11:47,571 --> 02:11:49,640
Well, um...

1861
02:11:49,673 --> 02:11:52,409
the tomatoes moved from
the bottom shelf to the top shelf,

1862
02:11:52,442 --> 02:11:54,043
and subsequently,

1863
02:11:54,077 --> 02:11:56,179
uncooked the spaghetti.

1864
02:11:57,280 --> 02:11:58,280
Unquote.

1865
02:12:00,584 --> 02:12:03,530
I'm sorry, that makes absolutely no
sense. What are you talking about, sir?

1866
02:12:03,554 --> 02:12:06,389
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- The allegations, the trial...

1867
02:12:06,423 --> 02:12:08,425
We're good here. Thank you.

1868
02:12:08,458 --> 02:12:10,661
Statement in the court.

1869
02:12:10,694 --> 02:12:12,962
- Did I give a good quote?
- Yeah.

1870
02:12:12,996 --> 02:12:15,031
Spaghetti.

1871
02:12:15,064 --> 02:12:17,400
Hey, speaking of food,
I was thinking, um...

1872
02:12:19,402 --> 02:12:20,604
you should ask me to dinner.

1873
02:12:21,705 --> 02:12:23,139
D-Dinner with me?

1874
02:12:23,173 --> 02:12:25,709
Yes, a date, Barry.

1875
02:12:25,743 --> 02:12:28,612
Iris West,
do you wanna dinner-date me?

1876
02:12:28,646 --> 02:12:30,079
- I'd love to.
- Thank you.

1877
02:12:30,748 --> 02:12:32,048
I'd love to also.

1878
02:12:32,750 --> 02:12:33,950
Call me.

1879
02:12:55,438 --> 02:12:57,474
- Bruce!
<i>- Congratulations.</i>

1880
02:12:57,508 --> 02:13:00,376
Thank you. You have no idea
how good it is to hear your voice.

1881
02:13:00,410 --> 02:13:04,013
I... I have so much to tell you the next
time I see you, Bruce. You were right.

1882
02:13:04,047 --> 02:13:05,248
Okay? And I didn't listen.

1883
02:13:05,281 --> 02:13:07,217
And things did get very,
very weird,

1884
02:13:07,250 --> 02:13:09,385
but I put everything back,
I promise.

1885
02:13:09,419 --> 02:13:10,588
<i>I'm pulling up now.</i>

1886
02:13:11,789 --> 02:13:13,524
Oh, great.

1887
02:13:13,557 --> 02:13:15,267
- Get the shot.
- Sir, sir!

1888
02:13:15,291 --> 02:13:17,561
- Back up, please.
- Shot!

1889
02:13:17,595 --> 02:13:19,138
Sir, I'd like to ask
you for a video for the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

1890
02:13:19,162 --> 02:13:20,802
- Wayne! Wayne!
- Step aside.

1891
02:13:22,833 --> 02:13:24,535
Was it backed by
your own allegation?

1892
02:13:27,571 --> 02:13:29,138
Who the fuck is this?

1893
02:13:29,172 --> 02:13:30,932
He's not
answering any questions.

1894
02:13:31,775 --> 02:13:32,776
Hey, Barry.

1895
02:13:34,077 --> 02:13:35,411
No, wh-where's...

1896
02:13:36,279 --> 02:13:38,081
You're, you... No.

1897
02:13:38,114 --> 02:13:39,482
You can't...

1898
02:13:39,517 --> 02:13:41,619
You... You're not Batman.

1899
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:45,321
What's wrong with you?

1900
02:13:47,290 --> 02:13:48,626
Huh.

1901
02:13:52,796 --> 02:13:53,831

02:22:40,390 --> 02:22:42,259
I can't get drunk.

1932
02:22:42,292 --> 02:22:44,227
I can't get drink either.

1933
02:22:44,261 --> 02:22:46,696
Listen. Listen, I'm,
'cause I'm trying to... No, no, no.

1934
02:22:46,730 --> 02:22:49,175
'Cause what I'm trying to explain as
simply as I possibly can, I promise...

1935
02:22:49,199 --> 02:22:51,868
They were all Batman.
They were all Bruce Wayne.

1936
02:22:51,902 --> 02:22:53,780
But each of them was
a completely different person.

1937
02:22:53,804 --> 02:22:57,140
- So, on the other line-time...
- Timeline.

1938
02:22:57,174 --> 02:22:58,175
I'm the same guy?

1939
02:22:58,208 --> 02:22:59,876
Yeah. Actually, pretty much.

1940
02:22:59,910 --> 02:23:01,711
You're lovable, furry...

1941
02:23:01,745 --> 02:23:04,014
loyal, motivated by bacon.

1942
02:23:04,047 --> 02:23:05,982
All right, listen.

1943
02:23:06,016 --> 02:23:08,785
Thank you for making it more
simpler for me, Mr. Simple More.

1944
02:23:08,819 --> 02:23:10,687
Yeah, I'm doing my best.-

1945
02:23:10,720 --> 02:23:12,756
Look, you're missing
the larger premise here.

1946
02:23:12,789 --> 02:23:15,725
In my timeline, when I...

1947
02:23:17,027 --> 02:23:18,995
All right, come on.

1948
02:23:19,029 --> 02:23:20,664
Up, up, Broseidon.

1949
02:23:20,697 --> 02:23:22,199
All right, come on.

1950
02:23:22,232 --> 02:23:24,392
I thought you were gonna
sleep on the couch.

1951
02:23:25,068 --> 02:23:26,236
Arthur, I live right here.

1952
02:23:26,269 --> 02:23:27,304
Harry?

1953
02:23:28,672 --> 02:23:30,340
I live right here. It's okay.

1954
02:23:35,045 --> 02:23:36,146
Okay.

1955
02:23:36,179 --> 02:23:37,881
Oh, hey.

1956
02:23:37,914 --> 02:23:39,716
More beer.

1957
02:23:40,383 --> 02:23:43,053
Go fast. Oh, here! Here.

1958
02:23:43,086 --> 02:23:46,756
Here. Pay with this.

1959
02:23:46,790 --> 02:23:48,291
Arthur,
this is Atlantean treasure.

1960
02:23:48,325 --> 02:23:50,794
You... You tell them that.

1961
02:23:50,827 --> 02:23:53,763
<i>♪ Got no money
For the sailor suit I... ♪</i>

1962
02:23:53,797 --> 02:23:55,098
- Yep.
<i>- ♪ I'm a sailor... ♪</i>

1963
02:23:55,132 --> 02:23:56,132
You're a sailor.

1964
02:23:56,967 --> 02:23:57,968
He's fine.
