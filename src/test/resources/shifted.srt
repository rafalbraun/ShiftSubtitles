1
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:12,458
So, where do you want to start?

2
00:00:18,817 --> 00:00:20,108
I don't know.

3
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,160
Okay. Why'd you run away?

4
00:03:01,037 --> 00:03:03,350
Can we not talk about that?

5
00:03:05,024 --> 00:03:06,285
Why?

6
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:10,770
I don't know. 'Cause it was just like a,

7
00:03:10,795 --> 00:03:13,850
like a dumb, not-well-thought-out plan,

8
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:18,076
and I was, like,
drunk and reacting to shit.

9
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,248
Reacting to what?

10
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:27,325
Come on, I, I really...

11
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,287
don't wanna talk about it.

12
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:31,753
Okay.

13
00:03:32,107 --> 00:03:33,834
What do you want to talk about?

14
00:03:41,726 --> 00:03:44,232
I think I want to go off my hormones.

15
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:46,975
Mm.

16
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,951
Okay.

17
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,347
Have you been thinking a lot
about de-transitioning?

18
00:03:55,183 --> 00:03:56,558
No.

19
00:03:56,706 --> 00:03:58,709
Okay. Then what is it?

20
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,725
I don't know. I've just been, like,

21
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,875
thinking about what's next.

22
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,620
In what sense?

23
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,933
I mean...

24
00:04:12,171 --> 00:04:15,350
I don't know. I guess
it's... I guess it's interesting,

25
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:18,100
'cause, like, before I ran away,

26
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:22,612
uh, I had gone to the city to
visit some old friends, and...

27
00:04:23,624 --> 00:04:26,892
we were having this exact conversation.

28
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:28,417
And...

29
00:04:29,495 --> 00:04:31,606
Basically, um...

30
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:36,683
I feel like I've framed

31
00:04:36,808 --> 00:04:41,300
my entire womanhood around men.

32
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,850
When, like, in reality,

33
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,959
I'm no longer interested in men.

34
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,236
Like, philosophically.

35
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:51,542
Like, like, what men want.

36
00:04:52,456 --> 00:04:56,308
Like, what men want is so boring.

37
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,225
And simple, and not creative,
and, like, uh...

38
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,642
I just, like, I look at myself,
and I'm like,

39
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:07,212
how the fuck did I spend my entire life

40
00:05:07,237 --> 00:05:09,581
building this. Like...

41
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:13,892
Like, my body, and my personality,

42
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:17,245
and, like, my soul around

43
00:05:17,683 --> 00:05:20,166
what I think men desire?

44
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,288
It's just, like...

45
00:05:24,755 --> 00:05:26,463
it's embarrassing.

46
00:05:27,963 --> 00:05:30,691
I feel like a... a fraud.

47
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,770
I feel like there's a lot to unpack
within what you just said, okay,

48
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,308
but the main thing I heard,

49
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,667
is how hard you are on yourself.

50
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,684
The amount of self-criticism
you're experiencing,

51
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:46,083
it's a lot.

52
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,625
Yeah.

53
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,276
But I, I think it's necessary.

54
00:05:52,315 --> 00:05:53,941
Are you sure?

55
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:57,750
I mean, I hope so.

56
00:05:58,824 --> 00:06:00,507
Or else,

57
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:03,407
then I'm really fucking crazy.

58
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,378
You're not crazy, Jules.

59
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:11,365
You're just a lot harder on yourself
than you probably should be.

60
00:06:13,805 --> 00:06:15,487
Yeah.

61
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,208
Acknowledging that's important.

62
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,931
Yeah, but, but also, like,
what I'm saying is true.

63
00:06:23,956 --> 00:06:28,866
Like, without the self-criticism,
I'd be lost.

64
00:06:29,878 --> 00:06:31,461
Or free.

65
00:06:33,198 --> 00:06:35,407
Both can be scary feelings.

66
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,995
You really feel like
your entire existence,

67
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:45,961
physically and emotionally,
is, is that reactive?

68
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,322
What do you mean?

69
00:06:48,347 --> 00:06:50,690
That I'm not looking
or talking to Jules?

70
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:54,919
I'm looking at an avatar she
created in reaction to the world?

71
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:59,300
Yeah. Yeah. I'm here. You know.

72
00:06:59,325 --> 00:07:03,298
But you're looking at, like,
a million layers of other people

73
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:06,849
that I've grabbed and clung to
throughout my entire life.

74
00:07:07,632 --> 00:07:10,298
That's, like, that's terrifying.

75
00:07:10,516 --> 00:07:11,924
It... I mean, that's why I think

76
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:15,323
when I was talking to
my friend about this, or...

77
00:07:16,215 --> 00:07:17,340
Or...

78
00:07:17,528 --> 00:07:20,273
Well, I don't, I don't know.
I guess this is, like,

79
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:22,105
this is our first session.

80
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,382
I don't want to get into all,
like, the childhood bullshit,

81
00:07:25,407 --> 00:07:27,505
'cause it's a lot.

82
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:29,782
It's exhausting.

83
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:33,549
But when I was having this
conversation with my friend,

84
00:07:33,805 --> 00:07:35,924
we were talking about how,

85
00:07:36,114 --> 00:07:37,782
I feel like

86
00:07:38,116 --> 00:07:43,310
my entire life, I've been trying
to conquer femininity,

87
00:07:44,073 --> 00:07:48,139
and somewhere along the way,

88
00:07:48,548 --> 00:07:51,090
I feel like femininity

89
00:07:51,115 --> 00:07:52,949
conquered me.

90
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,164
What?

91
00:08:03,373 --> 00:08:04,779
What?

92
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,766
What was that thought?

93
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,132
Well...

94
00:08:12,775 --> 00:08:14,173
Like...

95
00:08:14,404 --> 00:08:17,192
Most girls, when you first talk to them,

96
00:08:17,217 --> 00:08:22,211
they, like, automatically analyze
and compare themselves to you.

97
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:24,337
And then, you know, they,
they search for where you fit

98
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:26,000
in their hierarchy,

99
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:29,399
and then they treat you accordingly.

100
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,634
What hierarchy?

101
00:08:32,217 --> 00:08:37,438
Like, how close you are to what
they all collectively want to be.

102
00:08:37,463 --> 00:08:39,338
Like, in their heads.

103
00:08:39,732 --> 00:08:41,242
Right.

104
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:44,336
And, you know, even if
they've, like, mastered

105
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:48,278
the art of hiding it with,
like, smiles and nods,

106
00:08:48,303 --> 00:08:50,220
and small talk, it's, like,

107
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,610
you'd still catch them doing it.

108
00:08:52,635 --> 00:08:55,927
Like, like their eyes
wandering over your face, or...

109
00:08:56,135 --> 00:09:00,094
or, you know, the quick takes up
and down your body.

110
00:09:00,342 --> 00:09:04,050
Or like, they watch how your
clothes hang off your torso,

111
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:08,008
or, like, they look for what
tags are on your clothes

112
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:11,938
to see where you shop, or they'll
watch your hands to find, like,

113
00:09:12,362 --> 00:09:16,086
fucked-up cuticles
or chipped nail polish.

114
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:20,060
Honestly, it would,

115
00:09:20,085 --> 00:09:22,002
it would be a kind of sensual experience

116
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:25,078
if it wasn't so fucking terrifying.

117
00:09:27,342 --> 00:09:29,634
So they want to find flaws.

118
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:33,995
Yeah. Uh, most girls.

119
00:09:34,631 --> 00:09:36,464
But not Rue.

120
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:41,524
Mm-mm.

121
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,836
What's the first thing
that comes to mind?

122
00:10:00,503 --> 00:10:03,516
<i>No girl had ever looked
at me the way Rue did.</i>

123
00:10:11,884 --> 00:10:13,383
Hi.

124
00:10:16,836 --> 00:10:20,544
I just, I feel like
Rue was the first girl

125
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:23,819
that didn't just look at me.

126
00:10:25,173 --> 00:10:27,875
Like, she actually saw me.

127
00:10:28,698 --> 00:10:31,489
Uh, I mean, not to say that in,
like, a cheesy way,

128
00:10:31,514 --> 00:10:33,813
'cause it sounds cheesy, right? Like...

129
00:10:33,838 --> 00:10:36,055
Honestly, it sounds like a relief.

130
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,094
Yeah. It...

131
00:10:41,811 --> 00:10:44,383
But, I mean, like, when I say me,

132
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:47,658
I mean, I mean the me that I was
talking about earlier. Like...

133
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:52,203
The me that's underneath
a million layers of not me.

134
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:56,920
I can't imagine how that must have felt.

135
00:10:58,078 --> 00:10:59,412
Yeah.

136
00:11:01,063 --> 00:11:02,896
Yeah, it felt good.

137
00:11:11,182 --> 00:11:13,974
Kind of reminds me of
how a mom would see you.

138
00:11:15,703 --> 00:11:17,797
Keep going with that thought.

139
00:11:18,247 --> 00:11:19,915
Well, just like,

140
00:11:20,122 --> 00:11:23,438
how a mom sees you
before you're anything.

141
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:27,032
And, like, loves you just for that.

142
00:11:27,912 --> 00:11:31,245
And all you have to do is just,
like, sit there and exist.

143
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:34,379
Is that how your mom saw you?

144
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:42,211
I, I don't know. I mean, like,
the time we're talking about is

145
00:11:42,487 --> 00:11:45,320
before you can remember anything. So...

146
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:46,967
I don't know.

147
00:11:46,992 --> 00:11:49,446
Is that how you imagine
your mom saw you?

148
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:57,133
I hope so.

149
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,456
<i>Um, I take that back.</i>

150
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:18,897
<i>Uh, I don't wanna talk about my mom.</i>

151
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:22,136
I promise you, I have no agenda.

152
00:12:22,161 --> 00:12:24,281
We can talk about whatever
it is you wanna talk about.

153
00:12:24,814 --> 00:12:26,605
I mean, uh...

154
00:12:26,904 --> 00:12:30,894
Yeah. Uh, I think I really
wanna go off my hormones.

155
00:12:32,553 --> 00:12:34,136
Okay.

156
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:37,925
Or... Well, not like everything.

157
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:40,097
Probably just my blockers.

158
00:12:40,122 --> 00:12:45,705
I have, like, this weird
sci-fi chip implant in my arm.

159
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:48,050
- Supprelin?
- Yeah, and it, like,

160
00:12:48,075 --> 00:12:50,519
stops my voice from dropping.

161
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:54,199
Um, my balls from getting bigger,
you know?

162
00:12:54,224 --> 00:12:57,558
The kind of shit that men
wouldn't find desirable.

163
00:13:02,622 --> 00:13:04,542
I don't know. Uh...

164
00:13:05,138 --> 00:13:07,980
I've always thought of puberty

165
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:10,621
as, like, a broadening,

166
00:13:11,065 --> 00:13:14,706
or a deepening,
or like, a, a thickening.

167
00:13:15,276 --> 00:13:18,817
Which I, I think is, like, why I was
always so scared of it, you know?

168
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:21,199
'Cause in my head,
women were always, like,

169
00:13:21,224 --> 00:13:24,808
small and thin and delicate, and...

170
00:13:25,932 --> 00:13:30,316
You know, so, like,
the thought of puberty, like this...

171
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,324
irreversible, forever

172
00:13:32,349 --> 00:13:36,581
fucking metamorphosis was just,
like, fucking terrifying.

173
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:39,261
And, you know, that,
like, when it happened,

174
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:41,328
I'd just, like,
end up on the other side.

175
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,449
Like, stuck.

176
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:47,266
Or even worse, just, like, a man.

177
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,347
Like, like, through and through.

178
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:52,706
And then femininity would
always be this just, like,

179
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:56,800
this, like, elusive,
distant thing, you know?

180
00:13:57,618 --> 00:13:59,441
Like, unreachable.

181
00:13:59,703 --> 00:14:01,691
But, uh, but then,

182
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,382
I think about beautiful things

183
00:14:04,407 --> 00:14:08,285
that are also broad and deep,

184
00:14:08,317 --> 00:14:12,605
and thick, and I think of...

185
00:14:13,113 --> 00:14:15,667
something like the ocean.

186
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,701
I think, like...

187
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:27,479
that I want to be as
beautiful as the ocean.

188
00:14:28,654 --> 00:14:31,323
<i>'Cause the ocean's strong as fuck.</i>

189
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:32,848
<i>And feminine as fuck.</i>

190
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,873
<i>And, like, both are what
makes the ocean the ocean.</i>

191
00:14:37,348 --> 00:14:40,120
My grandmother used
to live by the ocean.

192
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,524
<i>And, uh, when we'd go visit,</i>

193
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:46,737
<i>we'd go down to the beach.</i>

194
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:52,054
<i>And, uh, I'd close my eyes...</i>

195
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:57,597
<i>And I'd just swim, and swim.</i>

196
00:14:57,622 --> 00:15:01,413
<i>And it didn't matter,
like, where I was going,</i>

197
00:15:01,438 --> 00:15:03,563
<i>or what could happen.</i>

198
00:15:04,827 --> 00:15:07,198
<i>Sometimes I'd pray to the ocean.</i>

199
00:15:17,861 --> 00:15:22,733
<i>At least for me,
being trans is spiritual.</i>

200
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:24,018
You know, it's not religious.

201
00:15:24,043 --> 00:15:26,834
It's not, like, for some congregation.

202
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,859
It's for me. It's mine.
It belongs to me.

203
00:15:31,286 --> 00:15:34,042
And I don't ever want to stand still.

204
00:15:34,245 --> 00:15:38,136
Like, I want to be alive.

205
00:15:39,207 --> 00:15:42,440
I mean, that's what this has
always been about, is, like...

206
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:46,046
staying alive.

207
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,714
The only problem is, um...

208
00:15:59,881 --> 00:16:02,881
I might have lost Rue along the way.

209
00:16:04,522 --> 00:16:05,980
What do you mean?

210
00:16:06,204 --> 00:16:08,745
Just that, like, I've,
I've called her a bunch of times,

211
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:12,698
and, um, she hasn't picked up, and...

212
00:16:13,983 --> 00:16:16,768
Like, I think I...
I think I really fucked up.

213
00:16:18,732 --> 00:16:20,523
But, like, I was panicking.

214
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:22,840
Like, I was really panicking.

215
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:31,691
Without, like, getting melodramatic...

216
00:16:42,372 --> 00:16:44,893
I've had a really hard six months.

217
00:16:48,255 --> 00:16:51,756
Like, moving here has been really hard.

218
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:56,709
And, like, I don't know. Just kind of...

219
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,854
A bunch of shit all
happened at once. And...

220
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:03,761
like, I just freaked out.

221
00:17:03,786 --> 00:17:05,869
Like, I panicked, and I felt like if I,

222
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:08,409
if I didn't get out,
I was gonna fucking die.

223
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,735
How?

224
00:17:18,263 --> 00:17:22,974
Mm, it's maybe, like, a little
hard for me to talk about right now.

225
00:17:24,803 --> 00:17:27,302
Were you thinking
about hurting yourself?

226
00:17:36,281 --> 00:17:37,934
I mean, um,

227
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:40,302
there's a difference between

228
00:17:40,675 --> 00:17:44,302
thinking about hurting yourself,
and, uh, wa...

229
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:46,410
wanting to hurt yourself. But...

230
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:51,151
I think that gap was closing.

231
00:18:07,782 --> 00:18:09,490
So, I ran.

232
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:19,046
And I left someone, like,
I really love, behind.

233
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:36,155
Sorry. Um, I don't know why I'm crying.

234
00:18:36,813 --> 00:18:38,265
Uh...

235
00:18:38,357 --> 00:18:40,108
'Cause it hurts.

236
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,296
Yeah. Um...

237
00:19:10,742 --> 00:19:12,499
Damn.

238
00:19:13,071 --> 00:19:15,320
Like, at the same time, though,

239
00:19:15,345 --> 00:19:17,220
I'm, like, really angry at Rue.

240
00:19:20,398 --> 00:19:22,566
I feel like...

241
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:24,561
her sobriety is, like,

242
00:19:24,586 --> 00:19:28,288
completely dependent on
how available I am to her.

243
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,710
You know? Like,

244
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:33,193
she'd ask me to sleep over,

245
00:19:33,218 --> 00:19:36,134
and I'd say no for,
like, whatever reason,

246
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:39,241
because it was a fucking weekday,
or something.

247
00:19:39,266 --> 00:19:41,530
And...

248
00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:45,920
I'd just, I'd feel, like, this weight.

249
00:19:47,831 --> 00:19:49,976
Like, this massive weight
on my shoulders,

250
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:51,667
and I'd think, like...

251
00:19:53,056 --> 00:19:56,138
Like, what if she relapses, you know?

252
00:19:58,672 --> 00:20:01,757
Like, what if she relapses
'cause I'm not there?

253
00:20:10,982 --> 00:20:13,409
<i>But I guess it goes
both ways, because...</i>

254
00:20:13,434 --> 00:20:14,601
<i>you know...</i>

255
00:20:20,758 --> 00:20:23,180
<i>I fell completely in love with her.</i>

256
00:21:07,105 --> 00:21:08,481
That was it!

257
00:21:08,506 --> 00:21:09,964
Oh, God.

258
00:21:10,231 --> 00:21:12,622
Yay! You did it!

259
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,605
- Thank you.
- Mmm...

260
00:21:23,758 --> 00:21:25,768
<i>I talked to your mom today.</i>

261
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,275
<i>She moved out of the halfway house.</i>

262
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,534
She's been clean for nine months.

263
00:21:31,475 --> 00:21:32,760
Don't do that.

264
00:21:32,785 --> 00:21:35,237
Please. Don't roll your eyes.

265
00:21:35,352 --> 00:21:37,352
- Come on. It's Mom.
- Yeah.

266
00:21:37,377 --> 00:21:39,221
You can be angry with her,

267
00:21:39,246 --> 00:21:40,621
and I understand that,

268
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:43,159
but you can't just dismiss the good.

269
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,784
Well, I'm allowed to be skeptical.

270
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:58,508
She did say she wanted to see you.

271
00:22:02,517 --> 00:22:03,945
I knew it.

272
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,710
I knew this was not just gonna be, like,

273
00:22:05,734 --> 00:22:08,586
some conversation about
how well Mom is doing.

274
00:22:09,682 --> 00:22:13,297
Um, you can tell her, "No, thank you."

275
00:22:16,938 --> 00:22:18,192
Okay.

276
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,344
<i>I was afraid to talk to Rue</i>

277
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:25,289
<i>about, like, shit that
was going on with my mom,</i>

278
00:22:25,314 --> 00:22:28,875
because she'd think that I
felt the same way about her

279
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,922
that, like, I do my mom.

280
00:22:31,245 --> 00:22:33,079
Well, don't you?

281
00:22:33,623 --> 00:22:35,109
What?

282
00:22:37,034 --> 00:22:39,812
Don't you feel the same way
about Rue as you do your mom?

283
00:22:41,301 --> 00:22:42,301
No.

284
00:22:42,326 --> 00:22:43,773
You just said you were angry at Rue

285
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:46,070
for the imbalance she created
in your relationship.

286
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,875
So, would it be fair to say that
you resented that imbalance?

287
00:22:51,123 --> 00:22:54,109
That the same person who saw you,
who truly saw you,

288
00:22:54,134 --> 00:22:56,483
in the same way that your
mom did when you were a baby,

289
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:59,844
was also incapable of seeing
how her additions affected you.

290
00:23:01,651 --> 00:23:04,133
I mean, uh, I guess I've, like,

291
00:23:04,158 --> 00:23:07,566
never thought about it
that way before. Um...

292
00:23:12,273 --> 00:23:13,829
Mom. Mom!

293
00:23:13,979 --> 00:23:15,566
For... Stop.

294
00:23:15,591 --> 00:23:18,634
I told you. I'm... I have a meeting
and then I'll be home.

295
00:23:19,177 --> 00:23:21,386
Yes. I'm fine.

296
00:23:22,493 --> 00:23:24,493
I'm literally fine.

297
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:26,939
Okay.

298
00:23:26,964 --> 00:23:29,267
Okay, I'll text you when I'm on my way.

299
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:31,001
Love you.

300
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:33,775
<i>I feel like real life
is always such a letdown.</i>

301
00:23:34,027 --> 00:23:37,251
- What do you mean?
- I don't know. It's just, like...

302
00:23:37,276 --> 00:23:40,777
easier to talk to people online.

303
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:45,657
You can be more open, and honest,

304
00:23:45,682 --> 00:23:48,640
and, like, vulnerable.

305
00:23:50,724 --> 00:23:53,400
_

306
00:23:54,384 --> 00:23:57,931
_

307
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:01,447
_

308
00:24:03,017 --> 00:24:06,415
_

309
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:11,529
_

310
00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:16,154
_

311
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,029
<i>Some of the most profound
relationships I've ever had</i>

312
00:24:19,054 --> 00:24:21,067
<i>have been with people I've never met.</i>

313
00:24:26,513 --> 00:24:29,097
<i>I should have known
I was setting myself up.</i>

314
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:33,875
<i>Or maybe I did know.</i>

315
00:24:36,716 --> 00:24:39,873
Maybe that's, like,
what I'm actually attracted to.

316
00:24:42,258 --> 00:24:44,550
<i>Maybe that's, like, the appeal.</i>

317
00:24:50,452 --> 00:24:51,869
The letdown.

318
00:24:56,029 --> 00:24:58,987
<i>The fact that, like, none of it's real.</i>

319
00:25:05,286 --> 00:25:07,161
And it's all a fantasy.

320
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:13,654
_

321
00:25:15,045 --> 00:25:17,631
_

322
00:25:49,795 --> 00:25:52,212
<i>You've never even seen his face.</i>

323
00:25:53,534 --> 00:25:55,412
I don't have to.

324
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:57,931
I've gotten to know him,
like, really well.

325
00:25:58,797 --> 00:26:00,004
Sure.

326
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:02,500
I have.

327
00:26:02,748 --> 00:26:05,771
Like, better than anyone else.

328
00:26:05,928 --> 00:26:07,803
Other than you.

329
00:26:10,386 --> 00:26:12,386
Except he could be lying.

330
00:26:13,374 --> 00:26:15,416
Rue, anyone could be lying.

331
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,490
Trust me, Rue. It's not in my head.

332
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:25,170
I think you two would
actually really get along.

333
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,670
<i>I fall in love so easily.</i>

334
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:33,255
I really do.
It's, like, almost embarrassing.

335
00:26:34,675 --> 00:26:36,592
Why do you think that is?

336
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:44,389
Because half of every
relationship is in my head.

337
00:27:08,008 --> 00:27:09,675
What?

338
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:12,252
Just happy I met you.

339
00:27:17,823 --> 00:27:19,323
Me, too.

340
00:27:26,907 --> 00:27:28,393
<i>Wait, Rue.</i>

341
00:27:28,418 --> 00:27:30,807
<i>You've been clean for, like, two weeks.</i>

342
00:27:31,829 --> 00:27:34,453
Rue! No fucking way!

343
00:27:34,478 --> 00:27:37,494
Mm! Mm! Mm!

344
00:27:38,702 --> 00:27:40,830
I'm so proud of you!

345
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:52,354
<i>There were so many times
I wanted to kiss her.</i>

346
00:28:25,732 --> 00:28:27,398
But I, I didn't.

347
00:28:27,592 --> 00:28:31,521
- Um, I'm gonna go get a glass of water.
- Oh. Okay.

348
00:28:36,807 --> 00:28:39,717
I hate everyone else
in the world but you.

349
00:28:40,703 --> 00:28:42,787
<i>And when she finally did...</i>

350
00:28:46,397 --> 00:28:49,224
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I should go.

351
00:28:53,638 --> 00:28:55,081
<i>I froze.</i>

352
00:28:56,115 --> 00:28:57,928
<i>Why do you think that is?</i>

353
00:28:59,343 --> 00:29:02,176
'Cause I had never kissed a girl before.

354
00:29:05,393 --> 00:29:09,060
I'd never even, like,
been that close to a girl before.

355
00:29:10,831 --> 00:29:12,521
<i>So when it happened,</i>

356
00:29:12,546 --> 00:29:14,865
<i>the only thought I had was, like,</i>

357
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:16,865
<i>don't lose her.</i>

358
00:29:17,133 --> 00:29:19,435
Um, hey, uh,

359
00:29:19,706 --> 00:29:22,539
I was just hoping we could talk
about what happened earlier,

360
00:29:22,564 --> 00:29:25,232
'cause, like, I know
I was really weird, and, um,

361
00:29:25,257 --> 00:29:27,959
I didn't, like,
mean it that way or anything.

362
00:29:28,193 --> 00:29:31,920
Um, so, yeah, uh, just...

363
00:29:31,945 --> 00:29:34,998
I just wanna talk to you.
Please call me back.

364
00:29:35,464 --> 00:29:36,756
Bye.

365
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,480
<i>Why did you think you would lose her?</i>

366
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,729
Because, like...

367
00:29:48,075 --> 00:29:50,783
How could it be possible
that Rue loved me

368
00:29:50,808 --> 00:29:52,795
as much as I loved her?

369
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:02,341
I think the better question is

370
00:30:02,366 --> 00:30:05,131
why would you think that
would be impossible?

371
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:29,967
_

372
00:30:30,584 --> 00:30:33,256
<i>I can't tell you how many times</i>

373
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:36,615
<i>we'd just be, like, texting and texting.</i>

374
00:30:36,749 --> 00:30:41,000
And the next thing I know, it would be,
like, four in the morning,

375
00:30:41,025 --> 00:30:44,691
and I hadn't slept,
and I didn't want to.

376
00:30:46,829 --> 00:30:49,224
Like, I'd never tell her this, but...

377
00:30:49,693 --> 00:30:53,068
I feel like I got to know
him better than I knew Rue.

378
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,779
We used to sext forever.

379
00:31:01,228 --> 00:31:04,436
Like, about anything and everything.

380
00:31:06,633 --> 00:31:09,787
I know it might, like,
sound a little weird, but...

381
00:31:11,071 --> 00:31:15,246
It was, like, genuinely
the best sex I've ever had.

382
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,690
What made it so fulfilling?

383
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:28,849
It was just pure fucking imagination.

384
00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:50,459
<i>All day I've been
thinking about you.</i>

385
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:58,219
<i>Dreaming about you.</i>

386
00:32:00,841 --> 00:32:03,748
<i>And all the things I want to do to you.</i>

387
00:32:08,896 --> 00:32:12,240
_

388
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:25,474
<i>I wish I could see your face...</i>

389
00:32:28,316 --> 00:32:30,881
<i>and all the colors in your eyes.</i>

390
00:32:36,489 --> 00:32:39,451
<i>Would you blush if
I told you I loved you?</i>

391
00:32:43,092 --> 00:32:44,584
_

392
00:32:46,428 --> 00:32:47,849
_

393
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,670
<i>I'm gonna fuck you until
you're soaking wet.</i>

394
00:33:20,491 --> 00:33:21,700
Tyler?

395
00:33:23,938 --> 00:33:26,177
Why are there no photos of us?

396
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:40,612
Because whoever I was
talking to didn't exist.

397
00:33:52,927 --> 00:33:54,218
Tyler?

398
00:33:56,524 --> 00:33:58,857
Jules, it's okay.

399
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:00,667
Come here.

400
00:34:03,677 --> 00:34:06,170
<i>How could none
of it have been real?</i>

401
00:34:11,448 --> 00:34:13,451
It felt so real.

402
00:34:19,048 --> 00:34:21,214
<i>I wish I never met him.</i>

403
00:34:25,487 --> 00:34:27,881
<i>I'm still in love with Tyler.</i>

404
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:33,528
<i>And I don't know
when that's gonna change.</i>

405
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,106
<i>Rue...</i>

406
00:36:08,055 --> 00:36:09,471
Don't look at my face.

407
00:36:17,164 --> 00:36:18,356
Rue.

408
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,488
Rue.

409
00:36:26,123 --> 00:36:27,504
Rue.

410
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,774
Guess what?

411
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:31,215
Rue!

412
00:36:34,677 --> 00:36:36,010
Rue?

413
00:36:43,515 --> 00:36:44,682
Rue!

414
00:36:44,707 --> 00:36:47,762
<i>Maybe it's 'cause of, like,
everything with my mom.</i>

415
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,434
<i>But I just had this, like,</i>

416
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:53,207
really bad nightmare about...

417
00:36:53,482 --> 00:36:56,106
living in New York City with Rue.

418
00:36:57,972 --> 00:37:00,246
When I got home, uh...

419
00:37:01,231 --> 00:37:03,426
she was in the bathroom.

420
00:37:04,449 --> 00:37:06,309
Rue?

421
00:37:06,693 --> 00:37:08,785
Can you please answer me?

422
00:37:09,266 --> 00:37:11,981
<i>But, like, she had locked it
from the inside.</i>

423
00:37:14,021 --> 00:37:15,938
Rue, please!

424
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,176
Rue, open the door!

425
00:37:25,171 --> 00:37:26,715
Then, like,

426
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,865
by the time I opened the door...

427
00:37:36,114 --> 00:37:38,948
I can't, like, say it out loud.

428
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:42,009
Rue! Rue!

429
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:45,314
Rue! Come on...

430
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,334
Rue!

431
00:37:54,593 --> 00:37:56,574
Rue! Open the f...

432
00:38:00,201 --> 00:38:02,949
Don't fucking do this to me!

433
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,365
Hi, Jules.

434
00:38:14,981 --> 00:38:16,440
Hey.

435
00:38:16,656 --> 00:38:18,323
You look really pretty.

436
00:38:19,818 --> 00:38:21,775
I wanted to say hi, and...

437
00:38:27,943 --> 00:38:29,776
It's okay. Hang tight.

438
00:38:46,204 --> 00:38:49,262
How could you just, like,
fucking ambush me like that?

439
00:38:50,434 --> 00:38:52,778
How could you fucking do this to me?

440
00:38:52,803 --> 00:38:55,332
Like, why didn't we talk about this?

441
00:38:55,773 --> 00:38:58,315
Because I knew that you
wouldn't give her a chance.

442
00:38:58,549 --> 00:38:59,799
Yeah.

443
00:39:00,188 --> 00:39:02,270
Yeah, there's a reason.

444
00:39:02,295 --> 00:39:04,670
Like, I can't handle this right now.

445
00:39:04,765 --> 00:39:08,486
I wouldn't have done this if
I didn't think you could handle it.

446
00:39:09,783 --> 00:39:12,775
What? So, like,
it's for my own good?

447
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,643
Jules, she's been clean.
She's doing really well.

448
00:39:16,668 --> 00:39:18,960
All she wants as part of her recovery

449
00:39:18,985 --> 00:39:20,955
is to make amends.

450
00:39:21,883 --> 00:39:23,215
Wait, what?

451
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:26,833
She wants to apologize.

452
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:31,106
You have to be fucking kidding me.

453
00:39:32,615 --> 00:39:35,073
She wants my forgiveness?

454
00:39:36,137 --> 00:39:38,192
My forgiveness?

455
00:39:38,217 --> 00:39:40,354
So that, what,
she doesn't, like, fucking

456
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:42,629
drink herself to death
because she's so guilty?

457
00:39:42,654 --> 00:39:45,229
Don't be fucking cruel!

458
00:39:46,963 --> 00:39:49,643
- I don't care!
- Yeah. You do.

459
00:39:49,668 --> 00:39:53,111
I swear to God,
Dad, I don't fucking care!

460
00:40:00,694 --> 00:40:02,400
Okay. Fine.

461
00:40:02,425 --> 00:40:04,604
If you really don't care,

462
00:40:04,629 --> 00:40:07,296
and this really means nothing to you,

463
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:10,072
then just go downstairs

464
00:40:10,097 --> 00:40:12,097
and let her apologize.

465
00:40:16,974 --> 00:40:18,766
Even if it's not real?

466
00:40:21,058 --> 00:40:22,892
Even if it's not real.

467
00:40:27,775 --> 00:40:28,995
Okay.

468
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,775
Okay. Fine.

469
00:41:13,978 --> 00:41:15,269
Jules.

470
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,611
It was a week later.

471
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,546
On Halloween.

472
00:41:27,056 --> 00:41:29,322
Uh, well, yeah.

473
00:41:30,096 --> 00:41:32,408
How long was she missing for?

474
00:41:33,998 --> 00:41:35,697
Jesus Christ.

475
00:41:35,722 --> 00:41:38,322
And, and you found bottles in the room?

476
00:41:39,546 --> 00:41:41,254
Oh, God...

477
00:41:43,442 --> 00:41:46,192
How, how long does the
hospital want to keep her?

478
00:41:50,623 --> 00:41:52,159
Jules...

479
00:41:53,586 --> 00:41:55,200
Uh, that's Rue.

480
00:41:55,225 --> 00:41:57,151
Hey. Jules.

481
00:41:59,653 --> 00:42:01,351
Jules, open up.

482
00:42:01,376 --> 00:42:02,752
You gotta come home, Jules.

483
00:42:02,777 --> 00:42:04,339
I can't come back.

484
00:42:04,435 --> 00:42:07,393
You're 17, you know.
You cannot live alone.

485
00:42:07,522 --> 00:42:10,128
This is not real life, Jules!

486
00:42:10,586 --> 00:42:13,359
I can't, I can't go back
to East Highland.

487
00:42:14,784 --> 00:42:16,343
Open the door.

488
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,812
You're coming home.

489
00:42:17,837 --> 00:42:19,628
I'm not leaving here without you!

490
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,854
I don't belong there.

491
00:42:22,574 --> 00:42:24,785
Jules, I'm begging you.

492
00:42:27,956 --> 00:42:29,456
Open the door!

493
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,420
Okay, well, that's all
the time we have for this week.

494
00:43:02,592 --> 00:43:05,359
Sorry if that was a lot.

495
00:43:06,258 --> 00:43:09,091
I'm the one person you
never have to apologize to.

496
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,136
Thanks.

497
00:43:12,492 --> 00:43:14,325
I know this is our first session,

498
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:16,683
and I know you didn't want to come,
but I'm glad you did.

499
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:18,374
I hope you are, too.

500
00:43:20,234 --> 00:43:24,276
Okay, so, just be patient with yourself.

501
00:43:26,278 --> 00:43:28,070
And have a wonderful New Year.

502
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:31,266
Merry Christmas.

503
00:43:31,654 --> 00:43:32,944
I'm Jewish.

504
00:43:32,969 --> 00:43:35,510
Oh, uh, sorry.

505
00:43:35,758 --> 00:43:37,175
Don't be.

506
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,242
It's a way better holiday.

507
00:43:41,882 --> 00:43:43,337

Uh, I was just...

00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:19,943
riding my bike, um,

518
00:44:20,118 --> 00:44:23,193
to go meet Ali, and I passed your house.

519
00:44:25,323 --> 00:44:27,032
And I...

520
00:44:27,057 --> 00:44:30,343

It's Christmastime, so...

00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:35,921
Your, your dad let me in.

523

Uh, uh, yeah. He's really mad at me.

524
00:44:39,735 --> 00:44:43,062
Um, I'm grounded.

525
00:44:43,286 --> 00:44:46,679
And, uh, in therapy. So, um...

526
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:50,000
Uh...

527
00:44:53,769 --> 00:44:55,435
I really missed you.

528
00:45:00,648 --> 00:45:02,422
Missed you, too.

529
00:45:04,593 --> 00:45:06,010
Um...

530
00:45:09,065 --> 00:45:11,788
Um, and I'm really sorry about, like,

531
00:45:11,813 --> 00:45:14,855
everything that happened
at the train station,

532
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,047
and leaving and stuff. Um...

533
00:45:21,451 --> 00:45:23,484
It was really fucking stupid.

534
00:45:23,509 --> 00:45:25,676
Ah, fuck. I don't know why I'm crying.

535
00:45:25,701 --> 00:45:29,796
